ALRIGHT GUYS , DON ' T BE SO PICKY ON THE LANGUAGE . GO WITH THE
SUBSTANCE . AS DRPAO RIGHTLY SAID ' ENGLISH IS JUST A TOOL FOR US SHOE
LESS LAO '
HERE ' S A RULE OF THUMB THAT I GO BY : IF ANYBODY HAS RAISED A KID WHO
IN TURN GETS A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN A FIRST - WORLD COUNTRY , THEN YOU ARE
FORGIVEN FOR YOUR BAD ENGLISH . YOU CAN WRITE CRAP AND I WILL NOT MIND .
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS . YOU HAVE DONE YOUR JOB .
