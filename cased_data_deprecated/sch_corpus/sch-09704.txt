It depends on the situation involved . Ua neeg nyob ib leeg tsuas muaj
nyog ib txoj sia xwb tawm sis yog yuav lom txwm luam neeg chiv chawj
puam liam kom luag nyoo los sis swb mas kawg nyuj qaug qwg yeej qaij
xwb . Other than that I believe I am just floating along fine .

Oui ....... oui ...... oui ....... yuav teb koj le caag txhaj le zoo yuad ?
Let me see ........ you said " most of you are nothing more than a bunch
of little children got stuck in a grown up body in needs of
guidance ..... who are extremely smart but yet brutal ."  Txhais le
caag ?........... yog tuaj tshev peb los tuaj qhuas peb ?  Muab nyeem
moog nyeem lug ....... koj tsi txawv dleb ntawm peb pestsawg kag le
nawb .
Maybe you forgot that the world is not square anymore .  It is
round ..... very round ........ and people are entitle to their own
opinions ......... if you cannot listen to what was said or is saying in
SCH then you are not ready to face the world .  You have a lot to grow
up into .  The people in this world are very cruel .  You only have one
family and one mother .  The only person who call you " mivnaib " is your
mother .  Lub ntiajteb no , yog koj mus tsuj raug lwm tus kuastaw ces
yeej mag kua  zaub ntsuab xwb .
Cov tuaj hauv no yog tib cov professional nkaus nkaus xwb hov ...... koj
tsis paub lov .  Hom professional mus rau sab twg los yeej muaj tag li
nawb ( e . i . professional yaim p** -- vaajmoob --- professional cem lus
dev ----- zhen ) Cov lus uas siv hauv no , yog kawm tawm los thiaj txawj
hais .  Tej lus dev lus npuas ntawd los kawm taiv tibsi thiaj txawj
hais tau tob npaum li ho ........ yog koj yog ib tus neeg tsi train los
hais lug phem koj yuav hais npaum twg los yeej hais tsi tau tob cuag
tus uas kawm tiav thiab niaj hnub siv li nawb ........  Adjust yourself
so that you can " fit in ."  Luag kiag 3 suab xwb ces zoo siab
lawm ........ heeeheeeheeee
