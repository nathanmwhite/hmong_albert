A. los peb sau ntawv tsis raug li luag, txhob lam tau lam hais txaj muag os koj yawg.

Victor Yang Kwv Victor Yang, Koj hais tias...

Yong Chanthalangsy, txawm yuav paub lus askiv,lus fabkis zoo npaum cas los kuv tsi k qhov Yong paub ntawv mab zoo ntawd tsis tseem ceeb dab tsi, qhov tseem ceeb peb yuav hais yog vim rau qhov nplog tua Hmoob, qhov uas kuv sau rau nws yuav nyiam raug thiab tsi raug los tsi ua cas, tsuav nws tau nyeem tias Hmoob pom paub txog tej xwm txheej uas cov nplog ua li cas rau Hmoob, qhov no yog qhov tseem ceeb qhov tseeb, cov lus kuv hais los saum twb yog cov THAB HAAM NPLOG hais tawm ntag, yus yog Hmoob lawm yuav tau tiv thaiv yus haiv neeg Hmoob mas thiaj tsim nyog nyob hauv Hmoob niam lub plab yug los ua Hmoob ib zaug.

Tsuas yog cov poj Hmoob mus yuav nplog lawm ces tsuav tau rab phom xwb ces nim yuav nrog nplog txhais peb cov ntawv lus Hmoob rau nplog liab tas mus li, yuav tau mus kawm ntawm nyablaj lub tswv yim tua Fab Kis tawm hauv nyab laj teb, ua ntej nyablaj yuav ntxeev tua fab kis, nyab laj tau muab nyablaj cov poj niam thiab cov ntxhais zoo nkauj mus yuav fabkis ua lawv poj niam, XWJ QHAUJ Fab Kis txoj dej num seb fab kis txoj siav lub chaw tuag nyob qhov twg, cov poj niam nyab laj soj ntsuam tau zoo zoo lawm xa xov tsi tseg qhia txog fabkis tej chaw nyob tseem ceeb rau Ho Chi Min thiab nws cov thawj peeb neeg paub, li no txog kawg lawv thiaj yeej teb chaws.
Thaum ub Suav tua tsi yeej Hmoob suav los kuj tso Suav cov ntxhais zoo nkauj tuaj yuav Hmoob, tuaj soj ntsuam Hmoob lub zog lub tswv yim coj mus qhia rau Suav tib yam txog kawg Suav thiaj yeej Hmoob.

Hmoob li ces mus yuav lawv lawm ces tab tuaj sab hauv qab mus tag tiam li lawm tsi paub yuav soj ntxeev qhia xov ib yam dab tsi tau rau Hmoob li, ua poj qev tuag nthi mus txog Hub tuag, muab saib los mas Hmoob poob cev qev los ntev lawm Hmoob tu ncua kev cob qhia txoj kev ua neeg lawm.

Koj sim xav seb maj cov Hmoob uas pab pab nplog liab tuag nthi ntawd nrhiav tswv yim nrog nplog liab txov txo Hmoob, lawv ho tau dab tsi?

Lawv tau daim nyuag ntawv qhuas hauv no xwb ne.

http://www.website.net/photos/***@N00/5256179076/in/photostream/ Koj click ib zaug tsi tawm tuaj, koj muab nias close, ces koj rov qhib zaum 2 ces tawm duab tuaj rau koj saib xwb.
Tej Hmoob ua rau nplog Hmoob ho tau dab tsi tseem ceeb uas yuav tsim yog mus pab nplog qhuas nplog ua luaj lis.

Koj puas tau pom dua nplog liab daim "LAO NEW MAP" hauv qab no koj pom lub npe hu ua "ANNAM" txhais tau tias yog Nyablaj no ov, ANNAM HIGHLAND no txhais tau tias lub teb chaws nplog yav qaum teb toj roob ntawd yog nyablaj li lawm xwb nplog tsi muaj feem lawm, nej sim nrog soj ntsia saib maj.....

http://www.website.net/img64/3331/37609288.jpg Yog tsi txawj saib yuav tsi paub txog dab tsi li ov, yog txawj saib ces nws tus kheej yuav paub tias lub teb chaws nplog ntawd raug muab faib rau nyab laj yuav yav qaum teb lawm.

YTK Phooj ywg, thiab Kwv Victor Yang, Kev sau ntawv muaj 3 yam sau, yam ib sau ntawv me nyuam yau, yam ob sau ntawv pej xeem thas mab das, yam 3 sau ntawv nom tswv, thaum yus saib taus nws yus sau kom raug raug li lo word lo lus ntawd, thaum yus saib tsi tsha taus nws lawm yus yuav sau tias u guys, or u gaiy no los tau, "the world" no yog lo lus raug raws li lus English, los lus "the would" tsis raug lawm, ho yog tib lo Would kuv yeej paub tias siv los pab dab tsi lawm, yuav sau tias "would you like to do something with me?
ib yam li lo lus U no tsi muaj dab tsi nyob hauv li, tab si yog sau kom raug tias "You" no yus paub tias yog dab tsi lawm.
Li no nyob ntawm xav sau kom raug los tsi xav sau kom raug xwb "no matter what you can write" the correct word.

YTK YTK Still chsing croc...
oooopp...
one croc just swim pass....
quick.....

Ummm...
too bad..
it is gone...
just ahve to wait for the next croc to come by...
while waiting...
I have a chance to check on what is happing back at SCH....

Wow...
still the same stuff going....

Just 2 things..

Firstly, Victor is right about Yong.
He is not just anybody.
If any one wants to have a debate with Yong, you need all the amunition you have...
over the years, I have most heated debate with Yong, he is a REAL Pro.
Many of our SCH members here are NOT up to the satandard to have a real debate with Yong.
So...
don't hang your self as most of the SCH are not yet Pro...
as Yong is.

Secondly, just on general issues that Yaj Tshaj Koob and others have floated around for the last few days when I was away...
So..
i will lump together and address these issiues generally...

Zab keep bringing up the Ruam issue..

Well...
Yuab ruam ho tsis RUAM kiag kom txaus.

Yuav NTSE ho TSIS ntse kom txaus thiab...

Ua ce peb pheej muaj cov niag neeg ua yuav ruam ho tsis ruam, yuav ntse ho tsis ntse tiag thiab...
li ib pab nyuag nyob hauv SCH.

Yog peb xam tias hauv SCH no lub zos microcosm rau Hmoob...
ces peb yuav hais tau tias, peb tseem muaj cov neeg li lawv ib pab hauv SCH no nyob ncig peb Hmoob lub Community at large...
this is WHY...
peb thiaj tsis muaj kev vammeej, ib theem zujzus, li lawm hais neeg.

Cov neeg IB NRAB no mas yog cov uas nrhiav tebmeem rau peb Sawvdaws thoob qhov chaw.

Ib tus neeg ZOO, Ntse tiag, li tej laus tau qhiav cia, nws yuav tsis vuag ub vuag no los mus hais phem rau tus ub tus no, liam ub liam no, hais txog luag lwm tus tej personal communication xwb los nws yeej vuag los ua tej niag zaj VWM tag li...
Tshum ub tshum no li...
Yog ib tus neeg txhawj-ntse tiag, tus neeg ntawd yeej yuav tsis lam vuag ub vuag no los hais, los mus tshum, los mus liam tus ub tus no uas nws tus KHEEJ twb tsis pab qab hau dabtsis, thiab nws TWB TSIS muaj pov thawj dabtsi li.

Ua ib tus neeg lam tau lam hais, twb tsis xav kom zoo zo ua ntej tso.

For example, yog kuv tsis muaj kuv cov duab thiab Viseos los SHARE rau dawvdaws mas xyov sawvdaws & Yaj Tshaj Koob puas yuav paub txog tej medal ceremony (in detail) nyob Nplog teb, xyo tseem tsis paub tias leej twg tau txaiv thiab, Vim, kuv muaj kuv plaub (4) daim videos: http://www.website.net/watch?
v=UD1vwinlv5Q http://www.website.net/watch?
v=E2CngAOXWko http://www.website.net/watch?
v=eZdcpxuNMW4 http://www.website.net/watch?
v=uQga7WiiswU thiab cov duab: http://www.website.net/photos/***@N00/with/5256179076/ los share rau sawvdaws es s/d thiab PAUB txog, thiab POM qhov tseeb, muaj povthawj...
tsis li ntawv mas tus Yaj Tshaj koob xyov puas hnov NTXHIAB txog tej medal no thiab ned!!!

Just one thing to THINK about...
Nej Sawvdaws puas paub tias muaj ib pab Hmoob twb tau txais cov medal no thaum lub hli August 2010 nyob Vientiane lawm???
Kuv paub, kuv pom tag...
tabsi tej ntawd yog lawv personal issue...
yog lawv xav muaj los qhia sawvdaws/tsis qia los, nyob ntawm lawv pab ntawd!!
Nej puav paub txog pab Hmoob (nyob lwm tebchaws) no?
Lawv twb tau medal thaum Aughust 2010-thaum Neo Lao Sang Xat celebrate lawm 60 xyoo nyob thoob Laos???

Yaj Tshaj Koob, koj puas hnov ntxhiab txog pab Hmoob no???

Qhov kuv muab cov duab thiab videos (unedited)- Novemeber 201-- no los share rau sawvdaws mas yog ib qhov EDUCATION rau s/d kom tau paub tau pom, as it really happened in totality - kom s/d tau paub tau pom, tau KAWM...
vim tias no orther Hmong has the courage to publish all those events in totallity..
and very few Hmong have the OPPORTUNITY to be at the RIGHT place and be allowed to RECORD those events and published freely as I do.

Luag tej Hmoob txhawj-ntse tiag, luag khaws tej duab, tej videos no coj mus KAWM (as many inteelctual Hmong tau hais tuaj rau kuv - lawv mas kawm tau ntau kawg li txog tej duab/videos no)...
there are lots to learn from all my photos and videos...
txhua daim duab, txhuam daim video yeej muaj nws cov NTSHIAB lus/message nyob hauv...
Lots of people uas txhawj-ntse tiag mas lawm KAWM tau NTAU heev li txog kuv cov duab thiab videos vim tias nws yog thawj zaug uas ib tus Hmoob muaj peevxwm nkag tau mus txog haus luag tej circle of power es luag kuj pub yus yeej duab/vdideo freely coj los pub sawvdaws saib.
Nej cov Hmoob US no kuj tau mus Laos ntau zaus, cov raug caws mus Laos officially los kuj muaj coob leej...
eg DYD thiab coob leej ntxiv...
tabsis yav dhau los kuv yeej TSIS POM ib tug twg yuav muaj tau ib daim duab/ib daim video coj los qhia rau peb sawvdwas tau pom, rau peb pom li tias lawv mus txog Laos, lawm ua dabtsi, lawm pom dabtsi, lawv ntsib leej twg...

yuag hais licas, yus hais licas...

Xyoo 2006, thawj zaug kuv mus Laos, kuv yeej RECORD tag txog Neo Lao Sang Xat Congress, video record+ photo txog tej peb mus ntsib cov Nom Los Tshua txhua tus...
Xyoo 2010 no los tib yam...
kuv yeej muaj duab muaj videos tag...
tabsis tseem tsis tau muaj tawm tag xwb..
xws li mus ntsib tej Nom Los Tshuas coob tus - nrog luag noj mos, hauv cawv, hu nkauj ua si ect...
kuv yeej muaj videos/photo tag thiab laug yeej pub kuv muaj publish tau tau tag.
Tabsis kuv tseem tsis tau muaj sijhawm los muaj publish tawm tag xwb...

Tej videos/photo no mas yeej yog xav muab SHARE rau s/d li kuv tau hais los lawm...

nws TSIS YOG tias yus yuav coj los khosana txog yus tus kheeg, TSIS yog yuav lo khavtheeb txog yus tus kheej.

Li Dr Muas Choj tau hais los lawm, yus tej neeg no yeej TSIS XAV yuav los ua leej twg tus NOM.
Kev ua NOM ua TSWV, yus yeej tau ua, tau pom, tau experience los lawm vim yus pojyawm txwjtxoob yeej tau nrog Hmoob coj noj coj ua los tau ntau tiam neeg lawm...
Ua nom ua tswv mas yog kev UA QEV rau pejxeem xwb...
LIno, yus yeej tau ua txaws lawm.
We have done our share of SERVICE to the Hmong.
Lub koob, lub npe los yus yeej muaj koob muaj npe thoob ntiaj teb tag lawm...
no need to khavtheeb yuv tus kheeg rau leejtwg vim yus kev zoo, kev phem, Hmoob thoob qab ntuj yeej paub tag alwm.
In addition, as Dr Muas Choj said, we need nothing more in life...
only doing what we are doing, helping our family and friends, sharing with family & friends...
doing our own ways that we see fits, not as dictated by few people (as we see in SCH)...

not just to do things because we want to gain more popularity or personal gain.
We have enough as an individuals...
we have our family intact...
there is enough money in the Bank, not rich, but enough to live a normal life, day to day, eating 3 meal a days, two pairs of shoes, 4-5 set of good quality clothings as money can buy...
drive any car that we fancy..
eg I drive a Mini Merc A190, costing me $18000..
it is comfortably, economical and versatile - a car to drive from home to work and drive around, practicallity...
safety - but NOT to fancy people...
and we, as the parents & elders, have prepared well our next generations in our families to face the future...
in many ways, we have been able to duplicate ouselves to our children and family members...
no need to brag about it but it is just the reality..
eg.
my children are doing Ok as I said before...
one medical doctor, one lawyer, one nurse, one IT (as previosuly published in the Net)...
not bad for hilly, shoeless Hmong boy from Lima 38 who went to Oz with $20 in his pocket (after my father collect all his saving for his son to go abroad - yes...
my father had $20 for his son)!

As for all those duab thiab videos txog Laos, yav dhau los, from other Hmong, are those yees coj los ua lag ua luam xwb...
tseem yog mus nyhiav yeev xwb...
ib cov mas yog muaj nyiaj mus ntiav Nplog liab es yus thiab tau yees tej duab ntawv...
thaum lawm coj los publish tag, tej tug Hmoob (uas mus yees cov duab ntawd) tseem mag Nplog Liab muab lawv cov Npe rau cov Black List tibsis thiab...
tsis pub nkag Laos lawm los kuj muaj.
Zoo, rau qhov tias tom qab no, sawvdaws mus nrog tej Nom Tswn Los Tsuas sibtham ntau zaus txog tej no, es luag thiaj muaj cov Hmoob (yees duab.
video) no tsem tawm hauv cov black list tag law,.......

ooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppp.........
the crocs are back....

Got to chase this one....
have to go.
cheerio.....

until next time when there is no croc.

For now, just continue to enyoy all the good things in life..

Be a Positive messenger..
Talk about our family & friends BUT concentrate on their GOOD things,...

Talk GOOD about others for a change...

There are plenty of GOOD things to talk about....
why wasting time to dig on other people's NEGATIVE things...
as it is NONE of YOUR business in the first place...
and every one know all alraedy!!

Never pretend that YOU talk on behalf of the Hmong.

Do NOT use the excuse as YOU sayign things for the benefits of the Hmong!
There is NO such thing!

It is all ABOUT YOU....
so STOP using the Hmoob name as an EXCUSE.

YOU talk, because YOU want something - NEVER, never, never what the Hmong wanted!!!

If YOU have a problem with some ONE, do not use the EXCUSE that that person ahs problem with the Hmong!

The Hmong are NOT the problem....
but YOU are THE PROBLEM!

YOU are THE PROBLEM...
never, never the Hmong!

Others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye...
if YOU do nOT like it, YOU do NOT do it.
YOU SHOW your BETTER ways!

Always REMEMBER that a LEADER, a VISIONARY do things that 90% of the people do NOT like, do not want, do net agree...
Go and raed the biography of all great leaders in the world in any field...
they DID things that their followers or suborninate disagree.
Eg the late Walt Disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of his board DIASGREE with his idea...
then..
only then..
he would put that idea into practice.
Disney world is what his board said that it was impoosible to do it!
Yes...
90% of his board reject the idea of the Disney World project...
Walt Disney told himself "It is the greatest idea..."
and now it is history!

So, it OK to DIASGREE with others but do it in such way that you have enough EVIDENCE to SUPPORT your idea...
and leave at that.
Learn to adopt the ATTITUDE of AGREE to DIASAGREE.

Be as a carpenter, MEASURE TWICE before cut.
Tej laus yeej hais tias, "Mam xav, mam hais.."
.
Think Twice before open our mouth 'coz once said, that person has put himself in a position (no matter wheteher it is right or wrong) but he will DEFEND himslef to the end, even to the point of hanging himslef alive (eg.
Mouatony).
It takae a GREAT man of Wisdom, a man of high caliber to be able to say publiocally that he is WRONG and to be able to stand up to say, "Sorry".
SCH is a great mirror to reflect on each one of us of WHO we really are - the REAL person just flash out so CLEARLY every day...
but the sad thing is that only a few people (like B2BH) have noticed that - and learned from it.

It is time to wake up and face te REALITY...
if you see that the Hmong have problem...
then YOU may be THE problem...
'coz...
YOU can be THE problem or YOU can be the SOLUTION.

You have the Choice,....

IF IT'S TO BE, IT IS UP TO ME.....
let's adopt this saying for 2011.

oooooooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppp....
have to go....
more later.
another day.....

du.

"If it's to be, It is Up to ME!"

Still chsing croc...

YOU talk, because YOU want something - NEVER, never, never what the Hmong wanted!!!

If YOU have a problem with some ONE, do not use the EXCUSE that that person ahs problem with the Hmong!

The Hmong are NOT the problem....
but YOU are THE PROBLEM!

YOU are THE PROBLEM...
never, never the Hmong!

Others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye...
if YOU do nOT like it, YOU do NOT do it.
YOU SHOW your BETTER ways!

Always REMEMBER that a LEADER, a VISIONARY do things that 90% of the people do NOT like, do not want, do net agree...
Go and raed the biography of all great leaders in the world in any field...
they DID things that their followers or suborninate disagree.
Eg the late Walt Disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of his board DIASGREE with his idea...
then..
only then..
he would put that idea into practice.
Disney world is what his board said that it was impoosible to do it!
Yes...
90% of his board reject the idea of the Disney World project...
Walt Disney told himself "It is the greatest idea..."
and now it is history!

So, it OK to DIASGREE with others but do it in such way that you have enough...

Kuv xav tias nej cov ntseeg nplog liab tuaj nplog liab tog hais lawv lus qhuas lawv lub luag num tswj kav teb chaws ces nej tsi tag noj mov li os, nej tos nplog tso quav ces yog nej li mov, nplog liab tso zis ces yog nej li dej hau xwb los pauj.
Nej yuav tau order nplog cov quav thiab zis tsi txob pub pob ib qhov rau twg yog nej kev sov siab nawb.

Nej yuav ua li kom nplog liab qhuas nej tias nej mas paub paub tab, thiab ntse kawg no los, nej ntsia saum ntuj ntsuab seb puas pom nplog qhuas nej nawb cov kwv tij hlwb tsi qoos muag li ciab mes.

Mr.
Yong twb hais lus saib tsi taus nws lawm los tseem ua dev ntsuav co tw sawv si rau ub rau no.
Ntshe yog co tw rau nkauj nplog.

YTK dr pov ruam, txhob rawm maj khav khav yus tus kheej os, yav tag los yog luck los ntawm koj txiv xwb os mog, koj lub neej yog lawm yav tom ntej, cia history ma li qhia seb koj accomplish tau ab tsi at the end, this is just the beginning.
Qhov tseeg tiag koj twg raug nkag mus rau nplog liab lub pob tawb lawm.
Tus neeg ruam li koj ces, luag cov neeg txawj ntse muab lus mos lus muag lus qab zib coj los ntxias xwb cia li qaug quav rau luag yooj yim npaum koj yuav ua cas ua tau ib tug coj, txawj koj xav ua thiab tsis xav ua los yeej tsis tau ua tus loj vim koj yog neeg ruam yuav ua tsis tau tus loj, ua mus tsis taus tsis haum pej xeem hmoob thiab nplog.
Tab sis yog yuav siv koj mus nkag pob tawb li nplog siv mas koj yuav yog ib tug zoo siv rau ntawm hmoob thiab nplog nawb, qhia li rau koj paub.

Tej duab koj shared rau koj cov phooj ywg saib ntawv twb yog koj xav kom koj yog tus nroov tshaj ntawm koj pab pawg uas raug nplog ntxias mus nkab pob tawb ntag.
Peb yeej paub zoo tias muaj cov poj ntxoog coob tus uas niaj hnub no yeej rau caw thiab xa xov mus nplog tag li, ya nyab hoom mus mus los los thiab xa xov rau nplog liab, tsis yog koj xwb.

Lub sij hawm no cov ruam li koj muaj coob heev uas sib tw mus nkag nplog liab lub pob tawb vim tus twg los xav kom nrov ib yam li koj, tus twg los xav ua tus thawj twg nyob rau history, thiab ua tus qhev loj yaim qhov quav ntawm nplog ntag.
Kev ntsaw ua tus loj ntawm lwm haiv neeg yeej pab tsis tsis tau yus haiv neeg ib zaug li.

Yog koj tsis paub kuv mam li qhia me me rau koj paub.
vp ces txawm yog meskas tus qhev ntag, nyab laj qab teb txawm yog meskas thiab fabkis tus qhev, saddam txawm yog meskas tus qhev, phas nyas tub npis yog faib kis tus qhev sau se tsim txom hmoob ntag.
hais me me no xwb yog ko twm txog history ces cov neeg ua qhev rau lwm haiv li koj ces txog thaum kawg txhua yam koj tau los yeej yuav rau tshem tawm ib yam li history tau hais los no.

Yog ib tug neeg ntse, nws yuav tsis lam make concession rau ib qhov twg uas nws tsis paub qhov tseeb, tsis raws txoj cai li ntawm nplog liab.
Ib tug ntse nws xum yuav qhov honor ntawm nws haiv neeg nws tsis kam cia li ua li koj es xum mus qhuas nplog uas yam tsis muaj nuj nqis rau hmoob thiab tsis tau ib qho benefit rau hmoob me me li.

you are stupid Still chsing croc...
 oooopp...
one croc just swim pass....
quick.....

Ummm...
too bad..
it is gone...
just ahve to wait for the next croc to come  by...
while waiting...
I have a chance to check on what is happing back at SCH....

Wow...
still the same stuff going....

Just 2 things..

Firstly, Victor is right about Yong.
He is not just anybody.
If any one wants to have a debate with Yong, you need all the amunition you have...
over the years, I have most heated debate with Yong, he is a REAL Pro.
Many of our SCH members here are NOT up to the satandard to have a real debate with Yong.
So...
don't hang your self as most of the SCH are not yet Pro...
as Yong is.

Secondly, just on general issues that Yaj Tshaj Koob and others have floated around for the last few days when I was away...
So..
i will lump together and address these issiues generally...

Zab keep bringing up the Ruam issue..

Well...
Yuab ruam ho tsis RUAM kiag kom txaus.

Yuav NTSE ho TSIS ntse kom txaus thiab...

Ua ce peb pheej muaj cov niag neeg ua yuav ruam ho tsis ruam, yuav ntse ho tsis ntse tiag thiab...
li ib pab nyuag nyob hauv SCH.

Yog peb xam tias hauv SCH no lub zos microcosm rau Hmoob...
ces peb yuav hais tau tias, peb tseem muaj cov neeg li lawv ib pab hauv SCH no nyob ncig peb Hmoob lub Community at large...
this is WHY...
peb thiaj tsis muaj kev vammeej, ib theem zujzus, li lawm hais neeg.

Cov neeg IB NRAB no mas yog cov uas nrhiav tebmeem rau peb Sawvdaws thoob qhov chaw.

Ib tus neeg ZOO, Ntse tiag, li tej laus tau qhiav cia, nws yuav tsis vuag ub vuag no los mus hais phem rau tus ub tus no, liam ub liam no, hais txog luag lwm tus tej personal communication xwb los nws yeej vuag los ua tej niag zaj VWM tag li...
Tshum ub tshum no li...
Yog ib tus neeg txhawj-ntse tiag, tus neeg ntawd yeej yuav tsis lam vuag ub vuag no los hais, los mus tshum, los mus liam tus ub tus no uas nws tus KHEEJ twb tsis pab qab hau dabtsis, thiab nws TWB TSIS muaj pov thawj dabtsi li.

Ua ib tus neeg lam tau lam hais, twb tsis xav kom zoo zo ua ntej tso.

For example, yog kuv tsis muaj kuv cov duab thiab Viseos los SHARE rau dawvdaws mas xyov sawvdaws & Yaj Tshaj Koob puas yuav paub txog tej medal ceremony (in detail) nyob Nplog teb, xyo tseem tsis paub tias leej twg tau txaiv thiab, Vim, kuv muaj kuv plaub (4) daim videos:http://www.website.net/watch?
v=UD1vwinlv5Qhttp://www.website.net/watch?
v=E2CngAOXWkohttp://www.website.net/watch?
v=eZdcpxuNMW4http://www.website.net/watch?
v=uQga7WiiswU los share rau sawvdaws es s/d thiab PAUB txog, thiab POM qhov tseeb, muaj povthawj...
tsis li ntawv mas tus Yaj Tshaj koob xyov puas hnov NTXHIAB txog tej medal no thiab ned!!!

Just one thing to THINK about...
Nej Sawvdaws puas paub tias muaj ib pab Hmoob twb tau txais cov medal no thaum lub hli August 2010 nyob Vientiane lawm???
Kuv paub, kuv pom tag...
tabsi tej ntawd yog lawv personal issue...
yog lawv xav muaj los qhia sawvdaws/tsis qia los, nyob ntawm lawv pab ntawd!!
Nej puav paub txog pab Hmoob (nyob lwm tebchaws) no?
 Lawv twb tau medal thaum Aughust 2010-thaum Neo Lao Sang Xat celebrate lawm 60 xyoo nyob thoob Laos???

Yaj Tshaj Koob, koj puas hnov ntxhiab txog pab Hmoob no???

Qhov kuv muab cov duab thiab videos (unedited)- Novemeber 201--  no los share rau sawvdaws mas yog ib qhov EDUCATION rau s/d kom tau paub tau pom, as it really happened in totality  - kom s/d tau paub tau pom, tau KAWM...
vim tias no orther Hmong has the courage to publish all those events in totallity..
and very few Hmong have the OPPORTUNITY to be at the RIGHT place and be allowed to RECORD those events and published freely as I do.

Luag tej Hmoob txhawj-ntse tiag, luag khaws tej duab, tej videos no coj mus KAWM (as many inteelctual Hmong tau hais tuaj rau kuv - lawv mas kawm tau ntau kawg li txog tej duab/videos no)...
there are lots to learn from all my photos and videos...
txhua daim duab, txhuam daim video yeej muaj nws cov NTSHIAB lus/message nyob hauv...
Lots of people uas txhawj-ntse tiag mas lawm KAWM tau NTAU heev li txog kuv cov duab thiab videos vim tias nws yog thawj zaug uas ib tus Hmoob muaj peevxwm nkag tau mus txog haus luag tej circle of power es luag kuj pub yus yeej duab/vdideo freely coj los pub sawvdaws saib.
Nej cov Hmoob US no kuj tau mus Laos ntau zaus, cov raug caws mus Laos officially los kuj muaj coob leej...
eg DYD thiab coob leej ntxiv...
tabsis yav dhau los kuv yeej TSIS POM ib tug twg yuav muaj tau ib daim duab/ib daim video coj los qhia rau peb sawvdwas tau pom, rau peb pom li tias lawv mus txog Laos, lawm ua dabtsi, lawm pom dabtsi, lawv ntsib leej twg...

yuag hais licas, yus hais licas...

Xyoo 2006, thawj zaug kuv mus Laos, kuv yeej RECORD tag txog Neo Lao Sang Xat Congress, video record+ photo txog tej peb mus ntsib cov Nom Los Tshua txhua tus...
Xyoo 2010 no los tib yam...
kuv yeej muaj duab muaj videos tag...
tabsis tseem tsis tau muaj tawm tag xwb..
xws li mus ntsib tej Nom Los Tshuas coob tus - nrog luag noj mos, hauv cawv, hu nkauj ua si ect...
kuv yeej muaj videos/photo tag thiab laug yeej pub kuv muaj publish tau tau tag.
 Tabsis kuv tseem tsis tau muaj sijhawm los muaj publish tawm tag xwb...

Tej videos/photo no mas yeej yog xav muab SHARE rau s/d li kuv tau hais los lawm...

nws TSIS YOG tias yus yuav coj los khosana txog yus tus kheeg, TSIS yog yuav lo khavtheeb txog yus tus kheej.

Li Dr Muas Choj tau hais los lawm, yus tej neeg no yeej TSIS XAV yuav los ua leej twg tus NOM.
Kev ua NOM ua TSWV, yus yeej tau ua, tau pom, tau experience los lawm vim yus pojyawm txwjtxoob yeej tau nrog Hmoob coj noj coj ua los tau ntau tiam neeg lawm...
Ua nom ua tswv mas yog kev UA QEV rau pejxeem xwb...
LIno, yus yeej tau ua txaws lawm.
We have done our share of SERVICE to the Hmong.
Lub koob, lub npe los yus yeej muaj koob muaj npe thoob ntiaj teb tag lawm...
no need to khavtheeb yuv tus kheeg rau leejtwg vim yus kev zoo, kev phem, Hmoob thoob qab ntuj yeej paub tag alwm.
In addition, as Dr Muas Choj said, we need nothing more in life...
only doing what we are doing, helping our family and friends, sharing with family & friends...
doing our own ways that we see fits, not as dictated by few people (as we see in SCH)...

not just to do things because we want to gain more popularity or personal gain.
We have enough as an individuals...
we have our family intact...
there is enough money in the Bank, not rich, but enough to live a normal life, day to day, eating 3 meal a days, two pairs of shoes, 4-5 set of good quality clothings as money can buy...
drive any car that we fancy..
eg I drive a Mini Merc A190, costing me $18000..
it is comfortably, economical and versatile - a car to drive from home to work and drive around, practicallity...
safety - but NOT to fancy people...
and we, as the parents & elders, have prepared well our next generations in our families to face the future...
in many ways,  we have been able to duplicate ouselves to our children and family members...
no need to brag about it but it is just the reality..
eg.
my children are doing Ok as I said before...
one medical doctor, one lawyer, one nurse, one IT (as previosuly published in the Net)...
not bad for hilly, shoeless Hmong boy from Lima 38 who went to Oz with $20 in his pocket (after my father collect all his saving for his son to go abroad - yes...
my father had $20 for his son)!

As for all those duab thiab videos txog Laos, yav dhau los, from other Hmong, are those yees coj los ua lag ua luam xwb...
tseem yog mus nyhiav yeev xwb...
ib cov mas yog muaj nyiaj mus ntiav Nplog liab es yus thiab tau yees tej duab ntawv...
thaum lawm coj los publish tag, tej tug Hmoob (uas mus yees cov duab ntawd) tseem mag Nplog Liab muab lawv cov Npe rau cov Black List tibsis thiab...
tsis pub nkag Laos lawm los kuj muaj.
Zoo, rau qhov tias tom qab no, sawvdaws mus nrog tej Nom Tswn Los Tsuas sibtham ntau zaus txog tej no, es luag thiaj muaj cov Hmoob (yees duab.
video) no tsem tawm hauv cov black list tag law,.......

ooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppp.........
the crocs are back....

Got to chase this one....
have to go.
cheerio.....

until next time when there is no croc.

For now, just continue to enyoy all the good things in life..

Be a Positive messenger..
Talk about our family & friends BUT concentrate on their GOOD things,...

Talk GOOD about others for a change...

There are plenty of GOOD things to talk about....
why wasting time to dig on other people's NEGATIVE things...
as it is NONE of YOUR business in the first place...
and every one know all alraedy!!

Never pretend that YOU talk on behalf of the Hmong.

Do NOT use the excuse as YOU sayign things for the benefits of the Hmong!
 There is NO such thing!

It is all ABOUT YOU....
so STOP using the Hmoob name as an EXCUSE.

YOU talk, because YOU want something - NEVER, never, never what the Hmong wanted!!!

If YOU have a problem with some ONE, do not use the EXCUSE that that person ahs problem with the Hmong!

The Hmong are NOT the problem....
but YOU are THE PROBLEM!

YOU are THE PROBLEM...
never, never the Hmong!

Others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye...
if YOU do nOT like it, YOU do NOT do it.
YOU SHOW your BETTER ways!

Always REMEMBER that a LEADER, a VISIONARY do things that 90% of the people do NOT like, do not want, do net agree...
Go and raed the biography of all great leaders in the world in any field...
they DID things that their followers or suborninate disagree.
Eg the late Walt Disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of his board DIASGREE with his idea...

Disney world is what his board said that it was impoosible to do it!
Yes...
90% of his board reject the idea of the Disney World project...
Walt Disney told himself "It is the greatest idea..."
and now it is history!

So, it OK to DIASGREE with others but do it in such way that you have enough EVIDENCE to SUPPORT your idea...
and leave at that.
 Learn to adopt the ATTITUDE of AGREE to DIASAGREE.

Be as a carpenter, MEASURE TWICE before cut.
Tej laus yeej hais tias, "Mam xav, mam hais.."
.
 Think Twice before open our mouth 'coz once said, that person has put himself in a position (no matter wheteher it is right or wrong) but he will DEFEND himslef to the end, even to the point of hanging himslef alive (eg.
Mouatony).
It takae a GREAT man of Wisdom, a man of high caliber to be able to say publiocally that he is WRONG and to be able to stand up to say, "Sorry".
 SCH is a great mirror to reflect on each one of us of WHO we really are - the REAL person just flash out so CLEARLY every day...
but the sad thing is that only a few people (like B2BH) have noticed that - and learned from it.

It is time to wake up and face te REALITY...
if you see that the Hmong have problem...
then YOU may be THE problem...
'coz...
YOU can be THE problem or YOU can be the SOLUTION.

You have the Choice,....

IF IT'S TO BE, IT IS UP TO ME.....
let's adopt this saying for 2011.

oooooooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppp....
have to go....
more later.
another day.....

du.

"If it's to be, It is Up to ME!"

Post by Yaj Tshaj Koob those who kill the Hmong fighter have been promised automatic grass-root Communist party membership and a one-step promotion, together with a reward of six million kip "US $600" per head, said the military official, who requested anonymity.
A spokesman for the Laos Ministry of foreign Affairs in Vientiane dismissed by report.

Kev ua NOM ua TSWV, yus yeej tau ua, tau pom, tau experience los lawm vim yus pojyawm txwjtxoob yeej tau nrog Hmoob coj noj coj ua los tau ntau tiam neeg lawm...
Ua nom ua tswv mas yog kev UA QEV rau pejxeem xwb...
LIno, yus yeej tau ua txaws lawm.
We have done our share of SERVICE to the Hmong.
Lub koob, lub npe los yus yeej muaj koob muaj npe thoob ntiaj teb tag lawm...
no need to khavtheeb yuv tus kheeg rau leejtwg vim yus kev zoo, kev phem, Hmoob thoob qab ntuj yeej paub tag alwm.
In addition, as Dr Muas Choj said, we need nothing more in life...
only doing what we are doing, helping our family and friends, sharing with family & friends...
doing our own ways that we see fits, not as dictated by few people (as we see in SCH)...

not just to do things because we want to gain more popularity or personal gain.
We have enough as an individuals...
we have our family intact...
there is enough money in the Bank, not rich, but enough to live a normal life, day to day, eating 3 meal a days, two pairs of shoes, 4-5 set of good quality clothings as money can buy...
drive any car that we fancy..
eg I drive a Mini Merc A190, costing me $18000..
it is comfortably, economical and versatile - a car to drive from home to work and drive around, practicallity...
safety - but NOT to fancy people...
and we, as the parents & elders, have prepared well our next generations in our families to face the future...
in many ways,  we have been able to duplicate ouselves to our children and family members...
no need to brag about it but it is just the reality..
eg.
my children are doing Ok as I said before...
one medical doctor, one lawyer, one nurse, one IT (as previosuly published in the Net)...
not bad for hilly, shoeless Hmong boy from Lima 38 who went to Oz with $20 in his pocket (after my father collect all his saving for his son to go abroad - yes...
my father had $20 for his son)!

As for all those duab thiab videos txog Laos, yav dhau los, from other Hmong, are those yees coj los ua lag ua luam xwb...
tseem yog mus nyhiav yeev xwb...
ib cov mas yog muaj nyiaj mus ntiav Nplog liab es yus thiab tau yees tej duab ntawv...
thaum lawm coj los publish tag, tej tug Hmoob (uas mus yees cov duab ntawd) tseem mag Nplog Liab muab lawv cov Npe rau cov Black List tibsis thiab...
tsis pub nkag Laos lawm los kuj muaj.
Zoo, rau qhov tias tom qab no, sawvdaws mus nrog tej Nom Tswn Los Tsuas sibtham ntau zaus txog tej no, es luag thiaj muaj cov Hmoob (yees duab.
video) no tsem tawm hauv cov black list tag law,.......

ooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppp.........
the crocs are back....

Got to chase this one....
have to go.
cheerio.....

until next time when there is no croc.

For now, just continue to enyoy all the good things in life..

Be a Positive messenger..
Talk about our family & friends BUT concentrate on their GOOD things,...

Talk GOOD about others for a change...

There are plenty of GOOD things to talk about....
why wasting time to dig on other people's NEGATIVE things...
as it is NONE of YOUR business in the first place...
and every one know all alraedy!!

Never pretend that YOU talk on behalf of the Hmong.

Do NOT use the excuse as YOU sayign things for the benefits of the Hmong!
 There is NO such thing!

It is all ABOUT YOU....
so STOP using the Hmoob name as an EXCUSE.

YOU talk, because YOU want something - NEVER, never, never what the Hmong wanted!!!

If YOU have a problem with some ONE, do not use the EXCUSE that that person ahs problem with the Hmong!

The Hmong are NOT the problem....
but YOU are THE PROBLEM!

YOU are THE PROBLEM...
never, never the Hmong!

Others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye...
if YOU do nOT like it, YOU do NOT do it.
YOU SHOW your BETTER ways!

Always REMEMBER that a LEADER, a VISIONARY do things that 90% of the people do NOT like, do not want, do net agree...
Go and raed the biography of all great leaders in the world in any field...
they DID things that their followers or suborninate disagree.
Eg the late Walt Disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of his board DIASGREE with his idea...
then..
only then..
he would put that idea into practice.
Disney world is what his board said that it was impoosible to do it!
Yes...
90% of his board reject the idea of the Disney World project...
Walt Disney told himself "It is the greatest idea..."
and now it is history!

So, it OK to DIASGREE with others but do it in such way that you have enough...

read more » Lots of good points, and at the same time, lots of contradictions, even a tinge of pomposity sprinkled on, Dr.
Pao.

First, not sure I will fall for your croc hunting...
and at the same time, read through most of these postings...
AND responding with a nearly 2,000 word essay!
That's quite impressive, I must say, mate!
