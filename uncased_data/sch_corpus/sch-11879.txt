qhov uas kuv sau rau nws yuav nyiam raug thiab tsi raug los tsi ua

still chsing croc...  oooopp... one croc just swim pass.... quick.....
ummm... too bad.. it is gone... just ahve to wait for the next croc to
come  by... while waiting...i have a chance to check on what is
happing back at sch....
wow... still the same stuff going....
just 2 things..
firstly, victor is right about yong. he is not just anybody. if any
one wants to have a debate with yong, you need all the amunition you
have... over the years, i have most heated debate with yong, he is a
real pro. many of our sch members here are not up to the satandard to
have a real debate with yong. so... don't hang your self as most of
the sch are not yet pro... as yong is.
secondly, just on general issues that yaj tshaj koob and others have
floated around for the last few days when i was away... so.. i will
lump together and address these issiues generally...
zab keep bringing up the ruam issue..
well...yuab ruam ho tsis ruam kiag kom txaus.
yuav ntse ho tsis ntse kom txaus thiab...
ua ce peb pheej muaj cov niag neeg ua yuav ruam ho tsis ruam, yuav
ntse ho tsis ntse tiag thiab... li ib pab nyuag nyob hauv sch.
yog peb xam tias hauv sch no lub zos microcosm rau hmoob...ces peb
yuav hais tau tias, peb tseem muaj cov neeg li lawv ib pab hauv sch no
nyob ncig peb hmoob lub community at large... this is why... peb thiaj
tsis muaj kev vammeej, ib theem zujzus, li lawm hais neeg.
cov neeg ib nrab no mas yog cov uas nrhiav tebmeem rau peb sawvdaws
thoob qhov chaw.
ib tus neeg zoo, ntse tiag, li tej laus tau qhiav cia, nws yuav tsis
vuag ub vuag no los mus hais phem rau tus ub tus no, liam ub liam no,
hais txog luag lwm tus tej personal communication xwb los nws yeej
vuag los ua tej niag zaj vwm tag li...tshum ub tshum no li... yog ib
tus neeg txhawj-ntse tiag, tus neeg ntawd yeej yuav tsis lam vuag ub
vuag no los hais, los mus tshum, los mus liam tus ub tus no uas nws
tus kheej twb tsis pab qab hau dabtsis, thiab nws twb tsis muaj pov
thawj dabtsi li.
ua ib tus neeg lam tau lam hais, twb tsis xav kom zoo zo ua ntej tso.
for example, yog kuv tsis muaj kuv cov duab thiab viseos los share rau
dawvdaws mas xyov sawvdaws & yaj tshaj koob puas yuav paub txog tej
medal ceremony (in detail) nyob nplog teb, xyo tseem tsis paub tias
leej twg tau txaiv thiab, vim, kuv muaj kuv plaub (4) daim videos:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud1vwinlv5q
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2cngaoxwko
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezdcpxunmw4
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqga7wiiswu
thiab cov duab:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/***@n00/with/5256179076/
los share rau sawvdaws es s/d thiab paub txog, thiab pom qhov tseeb,
muaj povthawj... tsis li ntawv mas tus yaj tshaj koob xyov puas hnov
ntxhiab txog tej medal no thiab ned!!!
just one thing to think about... nej sawvdaws puas paub tias muaj ib
pab hmoob twb tau txais cov medal no thaum lub hli august 2010 nyob
vientiane lawm??? kuv paub, kuv pom tag... tabsi tej ntawd yog lawv
personal issue... yog lawv xav muaj los qhia sawvdaws/tsis qia los,
nyob ntawm lawv pab ntawd!! nej puav paub txog pab hmoob (nyob lwm
tebchaws) no?  lawv twb tau medal thaum aughust 2010- thaum neo lao
sang xat celebrate lawm 60 xyoo nyob thoob laos???
yaj tshaj koob, koj puas hnov ntxhiab txog pab hmoob no???
qhov kuv muab cov duab thiab videos (unedited)- novemeber 201- -  no
los share rau sawvdaws mas yog ib qhov education rau s/d kom tau paub
tau pom, as it really happened in totality  - kom s/d tau paub tau
pom, tau kawm... vim tias no orther hmong has the courage to publish
all those events in totallity.. and very few hmong have the
opportunity to be at the right place and be allowed to record those
events and published freely as i do.
luag tej hmoob txhawj-ntse tiag, luag khaws tej duab, tej videos no
coj mus kawm (as many inteelctual hmong tau hais tuaj rau kuv - lawv
mas kawm tau ntau kawg li txog tej duab/videos no)... there are lots
to learn from all my photos and videos... txhua daim duab, txhuam daim
video yeej muaj nws cov ntshiab lus/message nyob hauv...lots of people
uas txhawj-ntse tiag mas lawm kawm tau ntau heev li txog kuv cov duab
thiab videos vim tias nws yog thawj zaug uas ib tus hmoob muaj peevxwm
nkag tau mus txog haus luag tej circle of power es luag kuj pub yus
yeej duab/vdideo freely coj los pub sawvdaws saib. nej cov hmoob us no
kuj tau mus laos ntau zaus, cov raug caws mus laos officially los kuj
muaj coob leej...eg dyd thiab coob leej ntxiv... tabsis yav dhau los
kuv yeej tsis pom ib tug twg yuav muaj tau ib daim duab/ib daim video
coj los qhia rau peb sawvdwas tau pom, rau peb pom li tias lawv mus
txog laos, lawm ua dabtsi, lawm pom dabtsi, lawv ntsib leej twg...
yuag hais licas, yus hais licas...
xyoo 2006, thawj zaug kuv mus laos, kuv yeej record tag txog neo lao
sang xat congress, video record+ photo txog tej peb mus ntsib cov nom
los tshua txhua tus...xyoo 2010 no los tib yam... kuv yeej muaj duab
muaj videos tag... tabsis tseem tsis tau muaj tawm tag xwb.. xws li
mus ntsib tej nom los tshuas coob tus - nrog luag noj mos, hauv cawv,
hu nkauj ua si ect... kuv yeej muaj videos/photo tag thiab laug yeej
pub kuv muaj publish tau tau tag.  tabsis kuv tseem tsis tau muaj
sijhawm los muaj publish tawm tag xwb...
tej videos/photo no mas yeej yog xav muab share rau s/d li kuv tau
hais los lawm...
nws tsis yog tias yus yuav coj los khosana txog yus tus kheeg,
tsis yog yuav lo khavtheeb txog yus tus kheej.
li dr muas choj tau hais los lawm, yus tej neeg no yeej tsis xav yuav
los ua leej twg tus nom. kev ua nom ua tswv, yus yeej tau ua, tau pom,
tau experience los lawm vim yus pojyawm txwjtxoob yeej tau nrog hmoob
coj noj coj ua los tau ntau tiam neeg lawm... ua nom ua tswv mas yog
kev ua qev rau pejxeem xwb...lino, yus yeej tau ua txaws lawm. we have
done our share of service to the hmong. lub koob, lub npe los yus yeej
muaj koob muaj npe thoob ntiaj teb tag lawm... no need to khavtheeb
yuv tus kheeg rau leejtwg vim yus kev zoo, kev phem, hmoob thoob qab
ntuj yeej paub tag alwm. in addition, as dr muas choj said, we need
nothing more in life... only doing what we are doing, helping our
family and friends, sharing with family & friends...doing our own ways
that we see fits, not as dictated by few people (as we see in sch)...
not just to do things because we want to gain more popularity or
personal gain. we have enough as an individuals... we have our family
intact... there is enough money in the bank, not rich, but enough to
live a normal life, day to day, eating 3 meal a days, two pairs of
shoes, 4-5 set of good quality clothings as money can buy... drive any
car that we fancy..eg i drive a mini merc a190, costing me $18000.. it
is comfortably, economical and versatile - a car to drive from home to
work and drive around, practicallity...safety - but not to fancy
people... and we, as the parents & elders, have prepared well our next
generations in our families to face the future...in many ways,  we
have been able to duplicate ouselves to our children and family
members... no need to brag about it but it is just the reality..eg. my
children are doing ok as i said before... one medical doctor, one
lawyer, one nurse, one it (as previosuly published in the net)... not
bad for hilly, shoeless hmong boy from lima 38 who went to oz with $20
in his pocket (after my father collect all his saving for his son to
go abroad - yes... my father had $20 for his son)!
as for all those duab thiab videos txog laos, yav dhau los, from other
hmong, are those yees coj los ua lag ua luam xwb... tseem yog mus
nyhiav yeev xwb... ib cov mas yog muaj nyiaj mus ntiav nplog liab es
yus thiab tau yees tej duab ntawv...thaum lawm coj los publish tag,
tej tug hmoob (uas mus yees cov duab ntawd) tseem mag nplog liab muab
lawv cov npe rau cov black list tibsis thiab...tsis pub nkag laos lawm
los kuj muaj. zoo, rau qhov tias tom qab no, sawvdaws mus nrog tej nom
tswn los tsuas sibtham ntau zaus txog tej no, es luag thiaj muaj cov
hmoob (yees duab.video) no tsem tawm hauv cov black list tag
law,.......
ooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppp......... the crocs are back....
got to chase this one.... have to go................... cheerio.....
until next time when there is no croc............
for now, just continue to enyoy all the good things in life..
be a positive messenger.. talk about our family & friends but
concentrate on their good things,...
talk good about others for a change...
there are plenty of good things to talk about....why wasting time to
dig on other people's negative things... as it is none of your
business in the first place... and every one know all alraedy!!
never pretend that you talk on behalf of the hmong.
do not use the excuse as you sayign things for the benefits of the
hmong!  there is no such thing!
it is all about you.... so stop using the hmoob name as an excuse.
you talk, because you want something - never, never, never what the
hmong wanted!!!
if you have a problem with some one, do not use the excuse that that
person ahs problem with the hmong!
the hmong are not the problem.... but you are the problem!
you are the problem... never, never the hmong!
others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye... if you do
not like it, you do not do it. you show your better ways!
always remember that a leader, a visionary do things that 90% of the
people do not like, do not want, do net agree... go and raed the
biography of all great leaders in the world in any field... they did
things that their followers or suborninate disagree. eg the late walt
disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of
his board diasgree with his idea... then.. only then.. he would put
that idea into practice. disney world is what his board said that it
was impoosible to do it! yes... 90% of his board reject the idea of
the disney world project... walt disney told himself "it is the
greatest idea..." and now it is history!
so, it ok to diasgree with others but do it in such way that you have
enough evidence to support your idea... and leave at that.  learn to
adopt the attitude of agree to diasagree.
be as a carpenter, measure twice before cut. tej laus yeej hais tias,
"mam xav, mam hais..".  think twice before open our mouth 'coz once
said, that person has put himself in a position (no matter wheteher it
is right or wrong) but he will defend himslef to the end, even to the
point of hanging himslef alive (eg. mouatony). it takae a great man of
wisdom, a man of high caliber to be able to say publiocally that he is
wrong and to be able to stand up to say, "sorry".  sch is a great
mirror to reflect on each one of us of who we really are - the real
person just flash out so clearly every day... but the sad thing is
that only a few people (like b2bh) have noticed that - and learned
from it.
it is time to wake up and face te reality... if you see that the hmong
have problem... then you may be the problem... 'coz... you can be the
problem or you can be the solution.
you have the choice,....
if it's to be, it is up to me..... let's adopt this saying for 2011.
oooooooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppp.... have to go.... more
later..........another day.....
du.
"if it's to be, it is up to me!"

still chsing croc...  oooopp... one croc just swim pass.... quick.....

talk good about others for a change...
there are plenty of good things to talk about....why wasting time to
dig on other people's negative things... as it is none of your
business in the first place... and every one know all alraedy!!
never pretend that you talk on behalf of the hmong.
do not use the excuse as you sayign things for the benefits of the
hmong!  there is no such thing!
it is all about you.... so stop using the hmoob name as an excuse.
you talk, because you want something - never, never, never what the
hmong wanted!!!
if you have a problem with some one, do not use the excuse that that
person ahs problem with the hmong!
the hmong are not the problem.... but you are the problem!
you are the problem... never, never the hmong!
others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye... if you do
not like it, you do not do it. you show your better ways!
always remember that a leader, a visionary do things that 90% of the
people do not like, do not want, do net agree... go and raed the
biography of all great leaders in the world in any field... they did
things that their followers or suborninate disagree. eg the late walt
disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of
his board diasgree with his idea... then.. only then.. he would put
that idea into practice. disney world is what his board said that it
was impoosible to do it! yes... 90% of his board reject the idea of
the disney world project... walt disney told himself "it is the
greatest idea..." and now it is history!
so, it ok to diasgree with others but do it in such way that you have
enough ...

you are stupid
still chsing croc...  oooopp... one croc just swim pass.... quick.....
ummm... too bad.. it is gone... just ahve to wait for the next croc to
come  by... while waiting...i have a chance to check on what is
happing back at sch....
wow... still the same stuff going....
just 2 things..
firstly, victor is right about yong. he is not just anybody. if any
one wants to have a debate with yong, you need all the amunition you
have... over the years, i have most heated debate with yong, he is a
real pro. many of our sch members here are not up to the satandard to
have a real debate with yong. so... don't hang your self as most of
the sch are not yet pro... as yong is.
secondly, just on general issues that yaj tshaj koob and others have
floated around for the last few days when i was away... so.. i will
lump together and address these issiues generally...
zab keep bringing up the ruam issue..
well...yuab ruam ho tsis ruam kiag kom txaus.
yuav ntse ho tsis ntse kom txaus thiab...
ua ce peb pheej muaj cov niag neeg ua yuav ruam ho tsis ruam, yuav
ntse ho tsis ntse tiag thiab... li ib pab nyuag nyob hauv sch.
yog peb xam tias hauv sch no lub zos microcosm rau hmoob...ces peb
yuav hais tau tias, peb tseem muaj cov neeg li lawv ib pab hauv sch no
nyob ncig peb hmoob lub community at large... this is why... peb thiaj
tsis muaj kev vammeej, ib theem zujzus, li lawm hais neeg.
 cov neeg ib nrab no mas yog cov uas nrhiav tebmeem rau peb sawvdaws
thoob qhov chaw.
ib tus neeg zoo, ntse tiag, li tej laus tau qhiav cia, nws yuav tsis
vuag ub vuag no los mus hais phem rau tus ub tus no, liam ub liam no,
hais txog luag lwm tus tej personal communication xwb los nws yeej
vuag los ua tej niag zaj vwm tag li...tshum ub tshum no li... yog ib
tus neeg txhawj-ntse tiag, tus neeg ntawd yeej yuav tsis lam vuag ub
vuag no los hais, los mus tshum, los mus liam tus ub tus no uas nws
tus kheej twb tsis pab qab hau dabtsis, thiab nws twb tsis muaj pov
thawj dabtsi li.
ua ib tus neeg lam tau lam hais, twb tsis xav kom zoo zo ua ntej tso.
for example, yog kuv tsis muaj kuv cov duab thiab viseos los share rau
dawvdaws mas xyov sawvdaws & yaj tshaj koob puas yuav paub txog tej
medal ceremony (in detail) nyob nplog teb, xyo tseem tsis paub tias
leej twg tau txaiv thiab, vim, kuv muaj kuv plaub (4) daim videos:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud1vwinlv5qhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2cngaoxwkohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezdcpxunmw4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqga7wiiswu
 los share rau sawvdaws es s/d thiab paub txog, thiab pom qhov tseeb,
muaj povthawj... tsis li ntawv mas tus yaj tshaj koob xyov puas hnov
ntxhiab txog tej medal no thiab ned!!!
just one thing to think about... nej sawvdaws puas paub tias muaj ib
pab hmoob twb tau txais cov medal no thaum lub hli august 2010 nyob
vientiane lawm??? kuv paub, kuv pom tag... tabsi tej ntawd yog lawv
personal issue... yog lawv xav muaj los qhia sawvdaws/tsis qia los,
nyob ntawm lawv pab ntawd!! nej puav paub txog pab hmoob (nyob lwm
tebchaws) no?  lawv twb tau medal thaum aughust 2010- thaum neo lao
sang xat celebrate lawm 60 xyoo nyob thoob laos???
yaj tshaj koob, koj puas hnov ntxhiab txog pab hmoob no???
qhov kuv muab cov duab thiab videos (unedited)- novemeber 201- -  no
los share rau sawvdaws mas yog ib qhov education rau s/d kom tau paub
tau pom, as it really happened in totality  - kom s/d tau paub tau
pom, tau kawm... vim tias no orther hmong has the courage to publish
all those events in totallity.. and very few hmong have the
opportunity to be at the right place and be allowed to record those
events and published freely as i do.
luag tej hmoob txhawj-ntse tiag, luag khaws tej duab, tej videos no
coj mus kawm (as many inteelctual hmong tau hais tuaj rau kuv - lawv
mas kawm tau ntau kawg li txog tej duab/videos no)... there are lots
to learn from all my photos and videos... txhua daim duab, txhuam daim
video yeej muaj nws cov ntshiab lus/message nyob hauv...lots of people
uas txhawj-ntse tiag mas lawm kawm tau ntau heev li txog kuv cov duab
thiab videos vim tias nws yog thawj zaug uas ib tus hmoob muaj peevxwm
nkag tau mus txog haus luag tej circle of power es luag kuj pub yus
yeej duab/vdideo freely coj los pub sawvdaws saib. nej cov hmoob us no
kuj tau mus laos ntau zaus, cov raug caws mus laos officially los kuj
muaj coob leej...eg dyd thiab coob leej ntxiv... tabsis yav dhau los
kuv yeej tsis pom ib tug twg yuav muaj tau ib daim duab/ib daim video
coj los qhia rau peb sawvdwas tau pom, rau peb pom li tias lawv mus
txog laos, lawm ua dabtsi, lawm pom dabtsi, lawv ntsib leej twg...
yuag hais licas, yus hais licas...
xyoo 2006, thawj zaug kuv mus laos, kuv yeej record tag txog neo lao
sang xat congress, video record+ photo txog tej peb mus ntsib cov nom
los tshua txhua tus...xyoo 2010 no los tib yam... kuv yeej muaj duab
muaj videos tag... tabsis tseem tsis tau muaj tawm tag xwb.. xws li
mus ntsib tej nom los tshuas coob tus - nrog luag noj mos, hauv cawv,
hu nkauj ua si ect... kuv yeej muaj videos/photo tag thiab laug yeej
pub kuv muaj publish tau tau tag.  tabsis kuv tseem tsis tau muaj
sijhawm los muaj publish tawm tag xwb...
tej videos/photo no mas yeej yog xav muab share rau s/d li kuv tau
hais los lawm...
nws tsis yog tias yus yuav coj los khosana txog yus tus kheeg,
tsis yog yuav lo khavtheeb txog yus tus kheej.
li dr muas choj tau hais los lawm, yus tej neeg no yeej tsis xav yuav
los ua leej twg tus nom. kev ua nom ua tswv, yus yeej tau ua, tau pom,
tau experience los lawm vim yus pojyawm txwjtxoob yeej tau nrog hmoob
coj noj coj ua los tau ntau tiam neeg lawm... ua nom ua tswv mas yog
kev ua qev rau pejxeem xwb...lino, yus yeej tau ua txaws lawm. we have
done our share of service to the hmong. lub koob, lub npe los yus yeej
muaj koob muaj npe thoob ntiaj teb tag lawm... no need to khavtheeb
yuv tus kheeg rau leejtwg vim yus kev zoo, kev phem, hmoob thoob qab
ntuj yeej paub tag alwm. in addition, as dr muas choj said, we need
nothing more in life... only doing what we are doing, helping our
family and friends, sharing with family & friends...doing our own ways
that we see fits, not as dictated by few people (as we see in sch)...
not just to do things because we want to gain more popularity or
personal gain. we have enough as an individuals... we have our family
intact... there is enough money in the bank, not rich, but enough to
live a normal life, day to day, eating 3 meal a days, two pairs of
shoes, 4-5 set of good quality clothings as money can buy... drive any
car that we fancy..eg i drive a mini merc a190, costing me $18000.. it
is comfortably, economical and versatile - a car to drive from home to
work and drive around, practicallity...safety - but not to fancy
people... and we, as the parents & elders, have prepared well our next
generations in our families to face the future...in many ways,  we
have been able to duplicate ouselves to our children and family
members... no need to brag about it but it is just the reality..eg. my
children are doing ok as i said before... one medical doctor, one
lawyer, one nurse, one it (as previosuly published in the net)... not
bad for hilly, shoeless hmong boy from lima 38 who went to oz with $20
in his pocket (after my father collect all his saving for his son to
go abroad - yes... my father had $20 for his son)!
as for all those duab thiab videos txog laos, yav dhau los, from other
hmong, are those yees coj los ua lag ua luam xwb... tseem yog mus
nyhiav yeev xwb... ib cov mas yog muaj nyiaj mus ntiav nplog liab es
yus thiab tau yees tej duab ntawv...thaum lawm coj los publish tag,
tej tug hmoob (uas mus yees cov duab ntawd) tseem mag nplog liab muab
lawv cov npe rau cov black list tibsis thiab...tsis pub nkag laos lawm
los kuj muaj. zoo, rau qhov tias tom qab no, sawvdaws mus nrog tej nom
tswn los tsuas sibtham ntau zaus txog tej no, es luag thiaj muaj cov
hmoob (yees duab.video) no tsem tawm hauv cov black list tag
law,.......
ooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppp......... the crocs are back....
got to chase this one.... have to go................... cheerio.....
until next time when there is no croc............
for now, just continue to enyoy all the good things in life..
be a positive messenger.. talk about our family & friends but
concentrate on their good things,...
talk good about others for a change...
there are plenty of good things to talk about....why wasting time to
dig on other people's negative things... as it is none of your
business in the first place... and every one know all alraedy!!
never pretend that you talk on behalf of the hmong.
do not use the excuse as you sayign things for the benefits of the
hmong!  there is no such thing!
it is all about you.... so stop using the hmoob name as an excuse.
you talk, because you want something - never, never, never what the
hmong wanted!!!
if you have a problem with some one, do not use the excuse that that

you are the problem... never, never the hmong!
others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye... if you do
not like it, you do not do it. you show your better ways!
always remember that a leader, a visionary do things that 90% of the
people do not like, do not want, do net agree... go and raed the
biography of all great leaders in the world in any field... they did
things that their followers or suborninate disagree. eg the late walt
disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of
his board diasgree with his idea... then.. only then.. he would put
that idea into practice. disney world is what his board said that it
was impoosible to do it! yes... 90% of his board reject the idea of
the disney world project... walt disney told himself "it is the
greatest idea..." and now it is history!
so, it ok to diasgree with others but do it in such way that you have
enough evidence to support your idea... and leave at that.  learn to
adopt the attitude of agree to diasagree.
be as a carpenter, measure twice before cut. tej laus yeej hais tias,
"mam xav, mam hais..".  think twice before open our mouth 'coz once
said, that person has put himself in a position (no matter wheteher it
is right or wrong) but he will defend himslef to the end, even to the
point of hanging himslef alive (eg. mouatony). it takae a great man of
wisdom, a man of high caliber to be able to say publiocally that he is
wrong and to be able to stand up to say, "sorry".  sch is a great
mirror to reflect on each one of us of who we really are - the real
person just flash out so clearly every day... but the sad thing is
that only a few people (like b2bh) have noticed that - and learned
from it.
it is time to wake up and face te reality... if you see that the hmong
have problem... then you may be the problem... 'coz... you can be the
problem or you can be the solution.
you have the choice,....
if it's to be, it is up to me..... let's adopt this saying for 2011.
oooooooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppp.... have to go.... more
later..........another day.....
du.
"if it's to be, it is up to me!"

muaj videos tag... tabsis tseem tsis tau muaj tawm tag xwb.. xws li
mus ntsib tej nom los tshuas coob tus - nrog luag noj mos, hauv cawv,
hu nkauj ua si ect... kuv yeej muaj videos/photo tag thiab laug yeej
pub kuv muaj publish tau tau tag.  tabsis kuv tseem tsis tau muaj
sijhawm los muaj publish tawm tag xwb...
tej videos/photo no mas yeej yog xav muab share rau s/d li kuv tau
hais los lawm...
nws tsis yog tias yus yuav coj los khosana txog yus tus kheeg,
tsis yog yuav lo khavtheeb txog yus tus kheej.
li dr muas choj tau hais los lawm, yus tej neeg no yeej tsis xav yuav
los ua leej twg tus nom. kev ua nom ua tswv, yus yeej tau ua, tau pom,
tau experience los lawm vim yus pojyawm txwjtxoob yeej tau nrog hmoob
coj noj coj ua los tau ntau tiam neeg lawm... ua nom ua tswv mas yog
kev ua qev rau pejxeem xwb...lino, yus yeej tau ua txaws lawm. we have
done our share of service to the hmong. lub koob, lub npe los yus yeej
muaj koob muaj npe thoob ntiaj teb tag lawm... no need to khavtheeb
yuv tus kheeg rau leejtwg vim yus kev zoo, kev phem, hmoob thoob qab
ntuj yeej paub tag alwm. in addition, as dr muas choj said, we need
nothing more in life... only doing what we are doing, helping our
family and friends, sharing with family & friends...doing our own ways
that we see fits, not as dictated by few people (as we see in sch)...
not just to do things because we want to gain more popularity or
personal gain. we have enough as an individuals... we have our family
intact... there is enough money in the bank, not rich, but enough to
live a normal life, day to day, eating 3 meal a days, two pairs of
shoes, 4-5 set of good quality clothings as money can buy... drive any
car that we fancy..eg i drive a mini merc a190, costing me $18000.. it
is comfortably, economical and versatile - a car to drive from home to
work and drive around, practicallity...safety - but not to fancy
people... and we, as the parents & elders, have prepared well our next
generations in our families to face the future...in many ways,  we
have been able to duplicate ouselves to our children and family
members... no need to brag about it but it is just the reality..eg. my
children are doing ok as i said before... one medical doctor, one
lawyer, one nurse, one it (as previosuly published in the net)... not
bad for hilly, shoeless hmong boy from lima 38 who went to oz with $20
in his pocket (after my father collect all his saving for his son to
go abroad - yes... my father had $20 for his son)!
as for all those duab thiab videos txog laos, yav dhau los, from other
hmong, are those yees coj los ua lag ua luam xwb... tseem yog mus
nyhiav yeev xwb... ib cov mas yog muaj nyiaj mus ntiav nplog liab es
yus thiab tau yees tej duab ntawv...thaum lawm coj los publish tag,
tej tug hmoob (uas mus yees cov duab ntawd) tseem mag nplog liab muab
lawv cov npe rau cov black list tibsis thiab...tsis pub nkag laos lawm
los kuj muaj. zoo, rau qhov tias tom qab no, sawvdaws mus nrog tej nom
tswn los tsuas sibtham ntau zaus txog tej no, es luag thiaj muaj cov
hmoob (yees duab.video) no tsem tawm hauv cov black list tag
law,.......
ooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppp......... the crocs are back....
got to chase this one.... have to go................... cheerio.....
until next time when there is no croc............
for now, just continue to enyoy all the good things in life..
be a positive messenger.. talk about our family & friends but
concentrate on their good things,...
talk good about others for a change...
there are plenty of good things to talk about....why wasting time to
dig on other people's negative things... as it is none of your
business in the first place... and every one know all alraedy!!
never pretend that you talk on behalf of the hmong.
do not use the excuse as you sayign things for the benefits of the
hmong!  there is no such thing!
it is all about you.... so stop using the hmoob name as an excuse.
you talk, because you want something - never, never, never what the
hmong wanted!!!
if you have a problem with some one, do not use the excuse that that
person ahs problem with the hmong!
the hmong are not the problem.... but you are the problem!
you are the problem... never, never the hmong!
others do their own ways as they see fit in their own eye... if you do
not like it, you do not do it. you show your better ways!
always remember that a leader, a visionary do things that 90% of the
people do not like, do not want, do net agree... go and raed the
biography of all great leaders in the world in any field... they did
things that their followers or suborninate disagree. eg the late walt
disney, whe he had an idea, he called his board members and if 90% of
his board diasgree with his idea... then.. only then.. he would put
that idea into practice. disney world is what his board said that it
was impoosible to do it! yes... 90% of his board reject the idea of
the disney world project... walt disney told himself "it is the
greatest idea..." and now it is history!
so, it ok to diasgree with others but do it in such way that you have
enough ...

lots of good points, and at the same time, lots of contradictions,
even a tinge of pomposity sprinkled on, dr. pao.
first, not sure i will fall for your croc hunting...and at the same
time, read through most of these postings...and responding with a
nearly 2,000 word essay! that's quite impressive, i must say, mate!
