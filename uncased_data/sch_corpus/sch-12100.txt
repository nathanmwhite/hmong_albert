if there's ever a war between china and vietnam, it will play nicely
into the american hands. there are a couple of motives for america to
get involved into this crap for one, america as a country has never
shied away from a war of any sort, on the contrary this country has
won two major world wars, has started a few wars of its own making and
on the other hand, what a better way to erase the national debt. war
makes money.
