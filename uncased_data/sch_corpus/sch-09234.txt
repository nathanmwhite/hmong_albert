still no pictures of the deportees.   why not show them to us?  really
in all sincerity if you have nothing to hide then why not show us
pictures of the 160 deportees?  most people agree if the lpdr would
just be honest most of this problem would go away.  the arrest of gvp
will not solve all your problems.  try amnesty and honesty for once
and then the lpdr can move forward.
