alright guys, don't be so picky on the language. go with the
substance. as drpao rightly said 'english is just a tool for us shoe
less lao'
here's a rule of thumb that i go by: if anybody has raised a kid who
in turn gets a doctorate degree in a first-world country, then you are
forgiven for your bad english. you can write crap and i will not mind.
nothing else matters. you have done your job.
