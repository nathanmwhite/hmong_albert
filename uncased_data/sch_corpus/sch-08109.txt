moobsib,
yog li no ntshe kuv yuav tau mus tab kuv lub non-profit koomhaum tam
sim no thiaj yuav tau txhais ib sab nyuag pie los ntawm niam pog
mccollum $2.5 million no paub.  yog mus tab tam sim no ces ntshe kuv
yuav tis tsis tau hais tias koomhaum qhia txuj ci.  ntshe yuav tau muab
tis npe hu ua, "koomhaum tshawb foob pob thiab pob txha."
-cha.

aib sayasith,
raws li kuv xauj pom mas txawm lawv pab no yuav mus nplog rov los thiab
tsi mus los lawv yeej tseem play their failure missions. vim li cas?
kuv pom li no:
1. pab neeg  mus ntawd tsi yog cov leaders ntawm haiv neeg nplog,
hmoob, khamu, lue, yao etc.. kuv considered lawv ua cov neeg fortune
seekers xwb. just a group of opportunistist persons not someone who can
solve the national problems.
2. lee chao tsuas yog ib tug rep. ntawm congreesmen office xwb. nws
yuav tsi muaj power decides over anaything. congressman comes and goes.
next term lee chao might be gone from the congressman office.
3. dr. yang dao the core leader of the team never act like a leader.
throughout his life, he never act as a front runner. his roles mostly
fit as an " advisor". an advisor  will never risk for anything.
4. their delegates are mostly from the unpopular background.  for
example ongsy. puangpan, seng fo, etc... mr. sananikone is a business
person. ongsy is  a former professor who played a very unstable roles
in politics. one time a kouxat  men at npps. one time a khamchong
follower, always here and there.  seng fo is the same. a khamchong
follower, a bussinessman, and never was a national leader in the past.
kuv pom the future of laos mus zoo li nram no:
1. yog nplogliab tsi kam pauv ces yeej yuav kawg raug ntiaj teb hnias
ib hnub xwb thiaj tas.
2. yog raug ntiaj teb hnias ces pab neeg no yuav dhau mus ua nplogliab
tog or the  opponants to the right wing party. yog nplogliab yeej ces
lawv o.k. yog nplogliab swb ces lawv yuav raug pressure los ntawm tog
dawb heev.
3. yog ho tshwm muaj kev sib ntaus sib tua no ces lub tebchaws nplog
yuav dhau mus ua anarchy. yog thaum dhau mus ua anarchy ces kawg ntiaj
teb yuav tau los tswj. thaum mus zoo li ntawd, tsuas muaj 2 pab neeg
nyob saum rooj lawm xwb. left vs right. nplog hu ua faim xaib faim
khuam.
4. thaum muaj free election,  the popular leaders will emerge.  the
opportunistists will be set aside or become followers to another group
again.  this group is not a "big deal" to any body. lao business is not
skyrocking any time soon.
he he he yog li ntawd, nej tsi txhob mus ntshai thiab pheej txhawj txog
pab neeg no. to me, it is not a big deal.  me nyuam yaus kov hmoov av
xwb os lawv. he he he lam tso dag xwb txhob lam khib khib siab qhov
muag txaij tas nawb mog.
lam aib.
