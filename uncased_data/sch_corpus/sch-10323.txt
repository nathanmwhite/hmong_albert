vim,
kuv ntseeg tias koj to taub kuv has txog dab tsi tiam sis koj xav dig
ib lo lug zuj zug kom hais tsis tag xwb. ua neeg ntiaj teb yeej ntshaw
noj ntshaw haus ces yeej ntshaw nyiaj xtiaj los mas- that's why you
and i get up every mornings to go to work. kuv tsuas yog xav cheem kom
sawvdaws xob xav tais vim yus muaj caum puav dollars ces yus yov
"muas" tau txhua tug ntxhais no xwb vim yeej muaj cov ntxhais uas tsis
desperate li nej hais ntawd thiab no.  i have relatives there too and
not all of them want to come the us or want their daughters to hook up
with hmong meskas.  i can't tell you who they are for i do not have
their permission to broadcast them here but i can assure you that such
people do exist.  if you can't accept this as reality/possibility,
then i can only feel sorry for you. hais li no xwb tau lawm mog vim
yog yuav cam tic for tat ces ntshai wb ob cov ntiv tes ntaus ntawv ua
carpeltunnel los ntshai twb tsis tiav nawb mog.
peace,
hk
