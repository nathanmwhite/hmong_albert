"fri, apr 21 2006 2:58 pm i just got the laboratory results back from
the monkey disease you contracted, it came from tseemyeej's wife and
mom. sorry, next time don't go to tseemyeej's house for sex okay? lol!
and next time, don't fuck monkeys."  a statement made by zhen.
"tsavlis xyooj neejsaub xyooj thooj phevliab, koj txiv neejsaub cov
phevliab tseem cam koj lub qhov muag lawm los cas? kuv niam los yog
xeem xyooj, kuv poj niam los yog xeem xyooj, koj txiv neejsaub los yog

xwb no pos yog?  nej sawv daws yog los ntawm tib tsob noob monkey li
koj hais saud pos yog?"  ly tub's statement.
qhov statement no made between zhen thiab tseemyeej who have been
referring to one another with dirty words.
zhen can call ly tub any name, but s/he has no right to say such thing
to tseemyeej's wife - who is one of my aunts.
zhen needs to apologize to aunt ly, tub.
if i do look like a monkey to ly, tub, i shall take pride and be one.
no apology on this.
