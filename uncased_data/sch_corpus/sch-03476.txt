hmongtusjetli,
ntau tus hluas hmoob tsis yog "becoming too americanize" nawb.  lawv
tsuas yog becoming stupid and self-centered xwb ov.  tiam sis peb yuav
tau ua siab ntev vim tias no yog ib qhov phase uas lawv yuav tau mus
dhau xwv lawv thiaj yuav xeev.  muaj tseeb, peb ib cov hluas ces cia
li get stuck in this phase and never outgrew (like some people here in
sch - still talking nonsense garbage all day in their 40s and 50s).
tsis tag li ntawd, peb yuav tau txaus siab hais tias vim cov hluas
express lawv tus kheej freely tau, peb thiaj muaj coob leej ntau tus
mus nrog luag ua doctor, lawyer, businessman, politician etc.  yog peb
yuam lawv nyob peb cov hmong culture nkaus xwb ntshai peb yuav tsis
caum tau lwm haiv neeg.
<dating outside of hmong community ....hmong are too uneducated or too
npaj nawj>
qhov no yog ib qhov teeb meem peb yuav tau ua zoo muab los xav thiab
nawb.  feem ntau kuv pom mas yog peb cov tub tsis thsua rau siab ua
neej, tsis xav nrog luag kawm txuj kawm ci, ib txhia twb tsis kam ua
hauj lwm lawm thiab cia niam txiv khwv rau nws noj nyob dawb dawb
xwb.  yog thaum zoo li no, cov ntxhais kawm siab thiab muaj hauj lwm
ua tib ntxiag ho tsis xav yuav lawv thiab.  tsis tas li ntawd, peb cov
ntxhais yeej coob dua cov tub lawm ces thaum kawg ib txhia thiaj tau
yuav cov sab nraud thiab los kuj muaj.
<too many are becoming gay and lesbian (does not want to date and
stay so single..felt happy to be with their groups (pab poj niam or
txiv neej).>
i agree that there are a few hmong who are gay and lesbian.  have you
met any of them in person and talked to them directly?  i have and i
understand them.  granted, i do not approve nor do i encourage anyone
to become gay.  sometimes, you can't help what and who you are.  i
also agree that for some - it's a choice, preference, convenience,
trend and/or a phase.  i have a nephew who is gay because he was born
that way.  who am i to judge him?  i also have an older cousin who is
gay - in the old day in laos, we refer to him as "nraug laus" and no
one ever took him seriously.  can you imagine living your whole life
not fitting in?  i am a mother and i would say, love your kids no
matter what labels they carry - girl, boy, gay.
