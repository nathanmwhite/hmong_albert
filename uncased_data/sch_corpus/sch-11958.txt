next lao pdr spokesmen will earn more than general khantai siphadon,
lao government always did and done time after time for corruption, you

do you guys see the source of wealth? it says that national wealth,
not self made or inherited like others so i would say that his wealth
are the nation of laos that he stole from foreigner's aide and it
should return to the people of hmong and laos. if he transfer that
money to other countries and hide somewhere for his family, he will be
responsible and his family too.
amen
