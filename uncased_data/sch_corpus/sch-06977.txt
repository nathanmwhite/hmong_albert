well sai, maina.
ib qho kws ua rua luas tsi quav ntsej peb los vim yog peb feem coob-
tseem ceeb mas tej pawg muaj zug- pheej npau suav tej yaam xu kev hab
qus zog lawm xwb os. le koj has lug lawd, "lub caij tsi tau siav" los
moob tseem tsi tau seej txaus.

we have exchanged numerous emails in sch and very little is
accomplished.  i'd like to meet with you and neohmong exclusively or
however you chose and discuss a concrete plan to help our stranded
hmong fellows.  why won't you want to meet me?  after all, we're still
hmong, right?  yog neohmong neb sincere tiag, tiag nej name ib qho
chaw kuv mam li tuaj.  yog neb kam los kuv tuaj yeej ua tus tos txais
neb and i will provide you the hospitality. tsev ti los neeg tsis ti.
kuv noj licas los neb lam nrog kuv noj.
what do you say? i also posted my phone number for you to call in a
couple of my previous threads.  txhob ntshai mas?  tej laus hais tias,
"niam txiv sibceg tas tsis nrauj lub txaj, peb haiv hmoob sibhais tas
los tsis nrauj tus cag." i really want to work with you. union is our
greatest strength.  united justice for hmong prevails.
i'm eagerly waiting ....

i know guys like you and neohmong are unable to show your faces where
there are good and genuine people. i have extended my invitation to
you openly but i can see you're by no mean what you claimed to be.
nej yeej lam qw thiab tshum neeg nram caj tw xwb tiag. i cannot take
neither one of you serious from this point on. tos nej lam khaws ntxub
neohom; nej yeej tsis muab cuab kav yuav nrog leej twg tham ua lub
siab dawb paug tiag.
