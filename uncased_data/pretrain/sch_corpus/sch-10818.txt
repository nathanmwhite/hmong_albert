nyob zoo brother...
tseg ntev lawm, koj nyob li cas lawm.  this is just a thought for you
to consider.  in addition to spelling bee, why not a "translation bee"
too.
vim li cas kuv hais li no, vim tias hmoob cov lus are very easy to
write, but very hard to translate because a high percentage are mixed
with other chinese words...
yaweh

tus kwv yaag,
lub nam tswv yim koj nyav hais ko yuav tshwm sim rua xyoo tuaj tum
ntej nuav...ua tsaug nawb. muaj laaj lim le caag yeej meev has tuaj
hab mog.
