the lpdr leaders are millionaires and billionaires.
school is not the important issue for them.
if them want the country to be smart and having enough technical know-how they could use a few of those house full money to create one of the most advance and best school on earth.

but that is not their intention and desire therefore nothing like thatis going to happen.
they prefer the citizens to be stupid and easy to control.
if the citizens got smarter they are much more likely to resist government control or management.
so spending a few houses full of money to create school is the opposite of their desires.
those lpdr leaders are smart enough to know what will unwrap their iron grip of the citizens and what will keep the citizen under control.
lets give an example lpdr had been killing citizens for decades yet little or no news leak-out into the world of internationals.
how many countries can do it like that?

do not even mention the killing and torture of people.
if one of us try to teach a dog a lesson the dog will scream and howl so loud that the whole village will know you are beating the dog.
lpdr is smart to squeeze the citizens nuts yet keep the citizen silence from internationalÂ´s perspective.
