i don't think we can say the loan officer misrepresented because we did not hear from both side how can we say the loan officer lied.
i don't know about the current rate, but i think it is very close to 6%, if so then the borrower did not lose any thing...
s/he actually got very very low interest rate at the first few months which is a plus for him or her.
even if s/he went directly to the bank for a conventional loan, it will be no lower than what /she got now.
as tsujsua said, typically at the time of closing the loan officer is required to explain thoroughly so it could be that the borrower went broke or some how s/he unable to keep up paying his 250k house and now turned it against the agent.
peb cov moob lub cuj pwm sab phem mas kuv yeej paub lawm, yog thaum yug yuav xaav kuas luag paab yug mas ua ntuj ua teb, yog luag paab tau le lub sab xaav mas txawm zoo ntaag hos yog luag paab tsis tau le yug lub saab nyam mas yeej nrav lug ab lam txhua yaam kuas nws zoo lub sab.
kuv very positive tas peb cov tub laag tub luam moob yuav tsis lam muaj cov muaj lub sab lim ham le hov coob, txawm muaj los tsuj tsawg le muaj ib tug vim tas puab txuj laj kam kev nrav noj nrav haus yog lug ntawm tej pej xeem xwb, kuas ntau zaag mas yug cov nom moog cuag luag no mas pheej yog cov nrav teeb meem nkaus xwb.

lonewriter, hais txog qhov teeb meem no kuv tus txiv laus twb mag ib zaug lawm.

qhov teeb meem loj mas tim tus loan agent.
tam sim no hmoob xav xav kom tau nyiaj ces lawv saib tus hmong buyer twg ruam ruam tsis paub dab tsi ces lawv dag rau ua rau tus hmong buyer no ntseeg tus hmong loan agent.
thaum tus buyer no mus kaw qhov loan, tus loan closer rep yeej explain rau nws tiag, tab sis nws twb ntseeg tus hmong loan agent lawm ces nws tsis pay attention rau tus loan closer rep no lawm.
li kuv twb yeej hais los nws zoo li tus hluas nkauj, tus buyer no twb mag tus yawg loan agent rab thawj teg lawm ces cov tom qab hais los nws yeej tsis pay attention rau lawm thiaj muaj teeb meem.
ib qhov teeb meem yeej tim yog tus buyer tsis pay attention tiag thiab, tab sis qhov teeb meem loj yog tim tus loan agent twb xub dag ua ntej lawm thiaj ua rau tus buyer tsis pay attention.
this is how it happened to my bro-in-law.

to all my hmong bros and sis out there, be aware!!!

-cha.

cov yawg, nej sim cia yog tus daj hau ua rau saib mas tus hmoob puas nroo ib suab ne.
