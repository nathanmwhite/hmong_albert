the catholic church, clergy, parishioners, in some instance, have supported stalking, harrassment, what happened at the eagan library, with some young man, coming in amongstt the stalking, rape harrassment, to say things in a loud voice, is the exact same thing, that parishioners, clergy have been involved in, stalking is going to be wrong, all should go to police, but i won't point fingers, however, i hope the likes of shaine, fr.
johnson, clark, hart, etc.
leave someone alone as well as the hmong vang girl, since women, have decided, crimes, don't give someone enough rights to meet women, to let it be said, those little kids on columbus circ le, returned to show their disrespectfuyl harrassment of life, charlie, you are obviously missing a lot of my sarcasm, but oh well...
i am honored that you would like to meet me in person, and i suppose that time will come sooner or later.
but as for the apology, i already did that so you needn't expect anymore--i am still waiting for you to accept the first apology, and then apologize to me.
here is a paj huam i made for you.

ua cas koj tseem zam txim tsis tau koj pheej kom kuv mob mob taub hau kuv twb mus nrog koj thov txim thiab tsis paub ua cas koj tsis kam hloov siab tsis ntev mam muaj ib hnub rau wb koj yuav pom tias koj yog tus swb txawm tias tsuas paub lus hmoob me me kuv yeej ua tswv, koj ua tub qhev paj huam no kuv tsis hais ntxiv mus tsam koj mloog tas mam thov txim rau kuv nawj!

xeng tswvntuj yeej muaj hwj huam thiab kev hlub loj heev thiaj txiav txim rau cov "american indians" kom yuav tsum ploj tag mus!

xeeb:...
you may call it sarcasism, but i work for social security and i've seen your resemblence in those claimants with speech impaired.
peb cov hmoob noj nyiaj ssi ces hais lus li cov ntawd koj sau hauv no.
roses are red; violets are blue the sarcasism is best in you.
