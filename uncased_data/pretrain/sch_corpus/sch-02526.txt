i have a question to ask.  is it the eyes that causes people to sin?
without the eyes can people sin?  now, can a blind person sin?

ok, whatever you call it, you still didn't answer my question?  is it
the eyes that causes people to commit bad things?  or is there such
thing as "bad" ?

npawg born,
yog tsis muaj kev txhaum (sin), tus neeg uas mus tua tibneeg tuag, yog
peb lam xav tias nws "txhaum" no xwb los yog nws yeej "txhaum" tiag?
yog kuv hais lus saib tsis taus koj es ua rau koj tsis txaus siab rau
kuv.  puas yog kuv ua txhaum rau koj los yog qhov ntawd yog koj kev
xav xwb, kuv yeej tsis tau ua txhum koj dab tsi li?
yog koj tus pojniam mus tham hluas nraug, qhov ntawd puas yog nws mus
ua txhaum lawm los yog qhov ntawd yog koj kev xav xwb, nws yeej tsis
tau ua txhaum dab tsi li?
puas yog neeg tsis kam lees tias muaj kev txhaum, neeg lub neej thiaj
piam tag li no?  kuv tsis yog xibhwb thiab tsis ntseeg ntuj tabsis kuv
yeej tseem xav tias yeej muaj kev txhaum (sin).  nej qhabnab no ho pab
abthibnpais rau peb kom peb to taub saib nej qhov term rau kev txhaum
ho yog li cas?  nej teb 3 qhov uas kuv nug saum no xwb ces tau lawm.
ua tsaug.

npawg liab,
==>> txawm ib tug neeg tua ib tug tib neeg tuag kiag lawm lod.  qhov
txhaum thiab tsi txhaum ntawd yog men’s judgement, not god’s
judgement.  vim yog mankind xav tias txhaum no ces txhua tus cias li
hais tias txhaum no xwb.  koj saib hmong men mas, yog ib tug neeg tua
ib tug yuam kev tuag lawm, lawv tsua nplhuas nws los pam lub ntee
thiab nplhuas nws nyiaj los them rau tsev neeg ntawd xwb.  nws twb tsi
tau mus nyob txim rau kaws li ned—qhov no, yog men tsim men txoj kev
xav thiab kev txhaum xwb…it is their choices to think in whatever way
they wish to be right or wrong.
==>> thaum koj hais lus saib tsit au kuv, qhov ntawd yog kuv li kev
xav xwb, qhov txhaum thiab tsi txhaum ntawd los nyob ntawm kuv tus
kheej txiav txim siab xwb.  yog kuv ok, ces koj yeej ok xwb.  yog tias
kuv xav tias txhaum no ces coj mus rau neeg mloog seb neeg hos xav li
cas xwb…so everything here is associated to what men think to be or
not to be.  there is no such thing as god’s judgments upon a term or
word…but it is all about men, and men’s own interpretation.
==>> qhov txhaum thiab tsi txhaum no yog men made, and there is
nothing that was directed from the high above as who is in fault.
during cave men era, men were like animal…they can sleep with as many
men and women as they wanted to.  it was men who were detected and
reconfigured these new approaches and morally correctness, to deter
what is right or wrong under the condition of mankind and men’s
thinking.
==>> qhov kev txhaum no mas neeg rov muab coj los cob qhia rau neeg,
kom neeg thiaj li nyob rau ua pab ua pawg thiab ua npoj nyob tau ua ib
ke kom txhob muaj muaj kev tubsab tubnyiag thiab thiaj li tsi muaj kev
sibntau sibtua xwb.  dhau li ntawd, yog men tsim los control neeg cov
behaviors kom zoo li rabkoob ua mus tau, los nyog li txoj xov xwb
nawb. nws tsi muaj dabtsi kiag, yog thaum koj lub qhov muag pom kev
deb thiab paub mus txog tej zoo li no tag lawm.
==>> yus yuav tsum tau nkagsiab rau yus tus kheej tias, kev txhaum no
tsi muaj—vim tib neeg txoj kev xav xwb, thiab yog tib neeg tsim tias
ua li cas txhaum, ua li cas hos tsi txhaum xwb.  nws tsi yog ib tug
tswvntuj nyob qhov qhia tias ua li cas es txhaum nawb no.  for our
reasons and supports are that men have their own freewill and choices,
therefore, morally right…right and wrong were detected, perceived,
identified and defined by men only men to be a certain that are right
and wrong. and, there is no such thing as whose god is defined for
mankind.

so, are you saying there's nothing wrong to kill others?  if you kill
some body and you think it's ok, then it's still ok?  wow...... you
are soooooo wrong here!

when a bad person (or perhaps there's no bad person according to you)
do something really bad, and he thinks it's ok and it's still good
then it's good.  when a stupid person eats his own quav and he says it
taste good, can you say it's good and agree to eat with him?
