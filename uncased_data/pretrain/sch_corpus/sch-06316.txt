what would be the reason you want hmong to unite?
are you really that distant from hmong?
i try to get away but no matter where i go there is always someone claiming to my my cousin or related to me. "
hey i got a cousin who married to your last name.
so what should i call you now?"

talk to any hmong and you know soon he/she is related to you.
they have an aunt that married your hmong moua clan and lives in austrialia.
