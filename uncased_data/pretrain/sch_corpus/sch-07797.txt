bee,
i disagree with you on your comment. you know poeple that are on
plublic assistant are not the hmong alone. i am pretty sure you should
not say that infront of your parents. you might get slap at your face.
you know some of the white trash would never appreciated you. it
doesn't matter how hard working you are. you should of have ask black
people how the whithe people treat them since they are here in the u.s.
before your lovely hmong people.
sincerely,
raven
