too bad it was a fire and by the time we see the news it had already done the burning and no one can help. this type of refugee camp is likely to get the fire to initiate easier due to a small camp area that over load with thousands of people.
fire burnt up vinai refugee camp in the 1980´s once too. it was only luck that some of the building ere prevented to be completely burnt just as the case of building #7 in the 04 center part of the fire. that building #7 were lid a few times but as the fire started a few hmong guy would be up on top of the building covered themselve with a wet blanket ran to the location of the fire. the fire is sure to be hot but with a wet blanket covered thos few people can get very clode to the fire and just a flip odf the blanket to cover the fire and the fire was extenguished. in a few second another fire started at the same location on tyop of the building another person would run the same style to fight the fire. it was only luck that that building #7 was rescued otherwise that whole region of 04 center would had been completely burnt. i was in 02 center and was playing soccer at the soccer playfield at the time the firwe started. i heard people screaming that 04 is buring so we ran to 04 in hundreds of people. i have some relatives in that #7 building so i was standing by the side of that building the whole tim 04 is undrt the fire. most every elders would be holding a gong( nruas neeb) in asking the help from god and guardians. people squeeze into that street in hundreds but i felt more like thousands but we can not help to put the fire off at the outer most east-side of 04. that row of building are quickly clean up by fire the next row was started to burnseveral time at building #7 but each time it started to burn the people kept ranup the building with a wet blanket covered the whole body ran close enough to the fire and flip the blanket to cover the fire. this method works wonderful at that time. i was in my 12-14 years old and all i can do was standing there to scream making sure people were alerted when building #7 got started with the fire. just scream and pointing the fingers to the burnib spot. 2-3 guys would repeat the wet blankets method up and down the building until the fire on the most outer row had completely clean up and there was no near by building for the fire to burn-up than i ran back to my soccer game. it was a day of screaming and chaostic commotion. i´m glad we lived through it and no people´s live is lost to that fire.
