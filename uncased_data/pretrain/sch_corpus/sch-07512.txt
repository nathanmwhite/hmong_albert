stop and listen, pleae be quit!!!

a california grade school teacher predict a few years ago that if hmong are here 50 years hmong will have hmong governor in the state.
look at this: do you see or know how early hmong ((usa) get up go to the farm?

do you know how late their kids study at night?

hmong might not get to the pres.
position, but will be at gov.
position for sure some day.

hmong are honest people.
