i would rather have people being able to protest on the street than cow-towing the party line and get your mouth shut like some remaining communist remnant regimes.

soumaly,are you saying that now you live in the land of freedom, you don't want to see any protest at all?
that would be like fleeing an oppressive regime only to embrace it once you find the real freedom.

come on.
make up your mind now or do you want a dictatorship here in america like dubya had wished for while he was the prez.
