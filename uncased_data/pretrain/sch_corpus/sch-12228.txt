kuv saib taag zaaj ib hab saib moog rua zaaj ob lawm hab.

nyav saib, kuj yog zoo saib kawg.
saib ntev moog kuj tsi zoo saib lawm vim yog txuj kev has moog rua evolution lawm.
thaus muab tej ntu ntawm tuabneeg saib thaubqaab moog rua tug baby, fetus, embryo, egg and sperm ces txawm muab saib le evolution.
lawv le tug txheejtxheem ntawd, nwg yog txuj kev chiv, luj, hlub, hag laug xwb.

nwg tsi yog evolution.
evolution yog txuj kev kws phlis, pauv, hloov kuas nyob taug rua tej ntu neej lawv le caijnyoog (space and time).

qai hab kaab sistov es dlhau moog ua tuabneeg tsi yog evolution.
kaab nyuamdlev noj nplooj, phlis, hab dlhau moog ua npaujnpaim tsi yog evolution.
nwg yeej muaj tug txheejtxheem kws yuav moog lawv le ntawd lawm (the process was set and the growth had to take place).

if it were evolution, as the old hmong saying, "a female fetus can evolve to be a male, if she knows that the parents would prefer a boy."
that is preference or survival as overtime animal evolve to adapt to their environment.
but, that was just speculation.
no one witness how it got started as we now learn of how a baby came to live from an egg and a sperm.

evolution, base on science, "we are just star dust."
that is something beyond the meaning of life.

zaaj ob yog sperm meets egg and than comes the baby.

zaaj peb yog baby luj, nkaag, paub ntshai, moogkev, haslug, totaub lwm tug, hab txawj dlaag.

zaaj plaub yog cev hloov, suab hloov, tuaj plaub, muaj nqai, muaj kaab mivnyuas, nrhav kev hlub (love), paub txug tugkheej (responsibility), paub qhov yog hab tsi yog, noog lug hab nyob txim, hab tav txivneej yawg tamsis tseem tsi tau paub taab.
