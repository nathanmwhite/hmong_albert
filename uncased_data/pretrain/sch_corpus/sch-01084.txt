nyob zoo cov kwvtij phoojywg sawvdaws, **sorry for my hmonglish...
as i wa swriting this at 2.30pm...

so just want to share some thoughts as they came to mind at this early hours.......
*** xyoo laus tag, xyoo tshiab 2012 tawm tuaj lawm, kuv tus nyob deb, tsis paub nej sawvdwas cov hauv no zoo.
licas los, peb sawvdaws yeej yog hmoob cov tub txhawj ntshais ntse, cov coj noj coj ua hauv peb hmoob lub communities nyob thoob tebchaws.

sawvdaws yeej yog ib pab neeg muaj kev mob siab xav pab peb hmoob.

tabsis vim his tias ib leej muaj ib yam tswv yim es thiaj ua rau coob leej tsis sib nkag siab.
tabsis qhov tseeb ces sawvdaws yeej xav ua kom tau tib yam, yeej muaj tib lub hom phiaj.

kuv tus kheej los yeej tsis txaws neej tabsis vim li luag lus askis hais tias, "there is more than one way to skin a cat".
lino, tej peb qho leej tau taug peb txoj kev txawv los peb yeej yog muaj lub hom phiab tib yam.

lino, xyoo laus tas lawm cia peb muab tej lus qub cia nrog xyoo laus mus.

peb pib txoj kev txhiab.

luag tej laus uas ua peb niam peb txiv tau tso sawvdaws cia ib xyoo ib tug, zujzus twg yuav tag...
ces kom peb nco lawv tej kev zoo, sau cia rau hau keebkwm hmoob mus..
for now,, cia lawv rip.

peb cov luas yuav yog cov take on the baton and run foward, thov txoj kev txhiab rau sawvdaws taug mus lawm yav tom ntej, kom peb hmoob vammej ib theen zujzus ntsiv mus ces tau lawm.

yog leej twg muaj caij kuj tuaj ncig xyuas peb cov hmoob nyob australia thiab.
peb tsawg tsawg tabsis peb kuj yog neeg australia uas pejkum peebchaws kuj saib peb ib yam li ib tus neeg australia thiab.

tsis tag lino xwb, australia yog ib lub tebchaws uas muaj kev phookywg zoo nrog tebchaws los tsuas, lino, tej qhov uas nej cov hmoob usa ua tsis tau, tejzaum peb cov hmoob oz kuj ho yuav muaj kev pab tau kum muaj thiab.

lino, kuv thiaj xav kom pev sawvdaws:act locally tabsis think globally...

kom xav tias peb hmoob sawvdaws yeej caij tib lub nqoj xwb.
yog peb ib leeg nquas peb lus nkoj mus ib sab li yus nyiam xwb, peb leej nqo mus 10 txog kev, peb hmoob yuav tsis mus tsis los, mus tis txog qhov twg.

txij no mus kom peb yuav tsum los mus nquam nqob kom muaj rythm li tej neej sibxeen nquam nkob es peb thiaj li yuav mus txog peb lub hom phiaj.

tsis tag lino xwb, 2012 no, kuv kuj xav kom pebsawvdaws sij sijhawm los mus txheeb xyaus txog peb tus kheej, saib peb paub yam twg tiag-tiag, peb paub yam twg me-ntsis xwb, thiab peb ho tseem tsis paib yam twg li.
es peb yuav tsum know what we know and know what we donot know.
thaum peb paub tseeb lino lawm, peb yuav tau hais peb tej lus kom phim peb tus kheeg lub meejmom.
peb zoo li ib cov ntoo..
tus twg zoo ua ncej kaum-tsev yuav tsum paub tias yus yeej haum ua nce kauwm xwb, tus tug phim us tus qab kuj yuav tsum ua tus qab.
ib tiam neeg peb tsuas muaj ib tug ntoo thiag phim ua nce tas xwb ces peb yuav tsum cia tus ntawd ua nces tas, niam hnub no raws li kuv pom mas peb savdaws tsis paub peb tus kheeg zoo txaus ces peb pheej sib txeeb ua tus nce ub nce no uas peb twg tsis phim ua los peb phem ua tus niag neeg liam tsev, pheej yuav ua kom tau yus nyiam li xwb.
kom xav li abraham lincold tau hais cia, i shall prepare, my time will come".
tej no yeej muaj tseeb.
raws li kuv tus kheej, ib tug hmoob nyob oz, kuv yeej prepare los tau 30 xyoo lawm tias muaj ib hnub kuv yuav tsum raum luag caws ua ib tug vipo mus los tsuas teb.
that is one of my goal that i have set some 30 years ago...
lino hnub txog yug thib, yus yeej the right person ntag....
ces luag yeej yuav thuaj thov yus mus.
tus ambassador los tsuas tau hu xov-tooj tuaj cawv kuv personally txog ob zawg kuv this kam mus laos xyoo 2006 li ib tus vip, uas yus mus qhov twg luag muaj police caij motor ua ntev kom tej lus txav kev kom tag, uas yus yeej tsis nres tej teeb liab li...
yus mus txog qhov twg, tej phao ban, chao mouang, chap khoueng yeej tuaj tos yus tag li tus vip.

tus uas raug escort yus mus mas yuav tsum yog in tus athibodee xwb thiab muaj peevxwwm ua tua coj yus kev...
pem qhaum teb thoob qab teb,,tejno yog ib qhov example rau sawvdaws pom xwb - tsis yog yuav tuaj khav dabtsis tabsis kuv piav ua ib qhov illustration tias..
we must prepare, we must study - undertake a self-education program (for me, i have read about 50 books/year...
so in total about just 150+ books on all subjects that is outside my medical field).
i was fortunate to meet a great leader many years ago and he told me that if you want to be whom you wnat to be, you must invest on your brain - so i have been doing just that over the alst 30 years).
so..
if you are well prepare, your time will come as abrham lincoln once siad.

so, peb sqawdaws yuavv tsum pib prepare peb tus kheej kom peb sawvdaws paub tsaus, kom peb no muaj peejxwm nrog luag poejkum tecbchawm neeg sawv tau sib txig, shoulder to shoulder, kom luag respect peb ib lawm li lwm haiv neeg.

tabsis ua ntev peb yuav ua tau li no, pev yuav tsum paub tias peb yog leej twg, peb lub homphiaj zoo dabtsis, peb kev thiag taw yog dabtsi, puab ruaj txaus.
li thaum kuv mus laos, kuv kev thiag-taw yog kuv lub tebchaws thiab kuv tus oz ambassador nyob vte tibsis.
libno, kuv kev mus laos yuav risky npaun twg los, at least yus yeej muaj kev thiag-taw ruaj txaus...
but nothing is 100% safe,,, but if you do not risk, you do not live life to the fullest.
every thing is risky but at least if it is an caculated risk zoo li rag teev uas yus muaj luj saib, licas los yus sab yeej hnyav dua lawm ces, it is the right thing to take on the risk.

peb hmoob no tseem ntse tsis tau tsaus.
peb tseem muaj xav ntiav heev_+ + li uas tsis phim tias peb muaj kev txhawj kev ntse.
100 tsav yav hauv kev ua neej, politic, no yeej yoojyim thiab yeej nkagsiab tau zoo, yog peb muab xav kom nws simple xwb.
kom peb xav tias ib tus neeg li souphanouvong khiag xwb, rawv li cov npooj tsawb 30 xyoo hais rau kuv tias luag twb tsis ntseeg yawg tias yawg yog tus liab nad!
lino es peb hmoob tseem tsi nkag siab thiab ces, txhais tau tias peb hmoob feemcoob tseem ntse tsis tau txog theem uas yuav mus nrog luag sib txuas lus thiab ua politic tau.

lino es thov kom 2012 no, kow sawvdaws tig los xaav rau yus tus kheej ua ntej.
know who you are, what platform u are standing, are you on the right track...
to hmmob lub homphiab?

first of all, know you know, and know you do not know.
\ be prepare and your time will come.
if you are the right person, people will come searching for you, no mattre where you may be.
if you goo enough, you will be found....
just make sure that you are good enough and you are prepare and be ready.
real leader is found at the right time.
so, all we need to do is to be good people, serving our family well, as the pre-requiste.
, them serve our extended family and out clan members and just serve any hmong that call on you.
if you aspire to be a leader, just think aboutn the degree and amount of service that you provide to your people...
never try to be a leader.

just be the best servant to humanity...

then....
your calling (opportunity) will come to you any time if you are well prepare (knowledge, experieence, finacially + great serice provider) +ready ( having the time, good health & mobility) + having the right personality + be at the right time + right place in history.

among the above qualities, the most important factor, as i have learned from reading the biographies of the great achievers in the history of mankind (just few 100+ peopel), is personality.
many people have all other qualities but they have the wrong type of personality.

basically, there are 4 main type of personality.

1. the choleric - the doer - domineering type...
like gvp, nixon 2. the thinker -eg.
the perfectiknist...
they spent all their time planing, thinking but never get around to sarat anything.

3. the sanguine - like ronald regan - he was defeated in his run for the republican presidential nomination in 1968 as well as 1976, but won both the nomination and election in 1980...
when america is devasted from the viertnam war.
reagan is need to bring live to the us people thru his humor.

4. the phlegmatic - peace maker..
eg.
geroge bush (father), johnson, carter.
obama.

: match your potential with america's leaders - http://www.website.net/gp/product/images/0800755634/ref=dp_image_0?
ie=utf8&n=283155&s=books then go on to others books as listed on this link: http://www.website.net/p/personality+improvement.html each person will rise to the demand of the situation.
therer are many young hmong who are eager to rise to be the hmong leaders.
but, many of these young intellectuals, some of the brightest young hmong, but the proplem is that they have the wrong type of personality and they will not be fit to be a hmong leader, given the presnenta state of the hmong communities that is gfragmented and yearning to be back as one communities once again.
so, those hmong intellectuals have been born at the wrong time.
they are to good people that the hmong do not wanted now.
their personalities is not fitting for the present situation.
in recent time, i have suggested to few hmong intellectuals, some of the brightest young hmong who wanted to emerge as the hmong leaders but they have the choleric personality which is not what the hmong wanted to have now.
they disregard my advice, some even misunderstood my advice as beeing against them...
and they proclaim themselves but overnight, they discovered that they are not the sorth of leader that the hmong wanted.

we must understand that the hmong are a fragmented community...
the hmong communitities are searching for a new leader (not the gvp-like person - not a choleric who do what he wants reagrdless of the people may think) but a phegmatic - a peacmaker person who can get along with all sections of the communities, who can accommodate all fractions, all sections --getting along with every strata of the communities, who can bring all the hmong back together.

so...
may 2012...
be the year that the right hmong leader emerger to bring unity, harmony to the ahmong communities across the globe.

cheerio...

pao, ua tsaug rau koj cov lus qhuab qhia peb sawv daws.
koj cov lus lub ntsiab tseeb ces 1. koj xav qhia rau sawv daws paub tias koj yeej prepared thiab ready ua ib tus thawj coj lawm es kom sawv daws must be prepared and ready ib yam li koj.

2. hais txog qhov hlub hmoob, tsuav yus hais tau kom ua tau li yus hais es ua ib tus qauv rau sawv daws xyaum thiab follow xwb.

3. nej cov vips raug nom tswv nplog caw mus es muaj police motor nrog nraim yam muaj ntsej muaj muag li koj hais ces nws tsis txawv qhov before 1975 es lawv caw huab tais sisavangvathana mus xyuas muang vieng xay ntag nawb....
thiab later es caw yawg phanyas lawv mus meeting pem sam neua, thiab caw yawg general bounpone maktheparack, supreme commander of the royal lao army mus visit china, but after the visit, his plane landed in sam neua, not wattay.
the difference tsuas yog thaum ntawd yog 75's hos nej li mas yog the 90's lawm xwb....
tab sis they are always the winner politically and you are the loser...

qhov kuv hais li no tsuas yog my personal opinion xwb.
li cas los you have the rights to say what you said...
best, yingb
