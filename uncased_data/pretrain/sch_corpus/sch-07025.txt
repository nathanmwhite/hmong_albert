neohmong: i know you never have the wisdom and courage to reveal yourself, so i'm going to grant you the opportunity to hide behind a screen name for as long as you want.
why would i waste $39.00 to find you while you keep pop'in up in sch?

ua neeg yog yus hais lus tsis zoo rau ib tug lawm ces yeej txaj muag tawm li koj.
nkaum twj ywm zoo dua yog koj ntshai tsis xav mus hais plaub hais ntug.
kuv mas (guarantee) yuav tsis ua licas rau koj tabsis there are many silent observers in sch who may not be so lenient toward your animosity of gvp and neohome.

yes!
it is pointless to debate with a man or woman with no face.
ntu no koj twb tsis tshua hais lus phem thiab zoo li koj xav tshwm ntsej tshwm muag kawg lawm tsuas yog koj tsis muaj wisdom txaus tsam tawm los ces ho defend tsistau koj tus kheej xwb.
tsis ua licas; tsuav koj txhob foob kuv xwb ces kuv yuav tsis counter-sue koj.
qhov kawg yog koj mus tuaj tog liab lawm los kuv tsuas tuaj kwv paib - qw, qw tom tej kev xwb ces tas li ntawd lawm.
demonstration and protest is a form of speech guaranteed under the us constitution, and it's not the same as seeking legal actions to prosecute a group just because you share different opinions.
tus twg yog tus xub mus ua lino ces nws yog tus tsis understand txog freedom of speech.
nws yuav tau mus kawm ntxiv.

yes!
i agreed.
we should not repeat the same mistake twice.

charlie charlie, you have the opportunity to do whatever you want or choose so.
again, i don't want to push you to do anything that againsts your will.
i like your theory, "ua neeg yog yus hais lus tsis zoo rau ib tug lawm ces yeej txaj muag tawm li koj."
your theory can very well apply everyone here but except you.

charlie, kuv tsuas tawm tswv yim hais tias kuv tsis nyiam neohome cov cai, xws li lawv tej kev pheej mus dag cov hmoob tim hav zoov tias yuav muaj teb chaws, yuav muaj teb chaws, tab sis tsis pom muaj li (qhov teeb meem no tsis yog kuv ib leeg thiaj paub txog xwb tiam sim hmoob feem coob yeej paub ib yam li kuv paub thiab).
hais li no xwb, ho txaj taus qhov muag li cas?
tos li peb tsis muaj teb chaws los hais li no xwb es twb tsis haum koj lawm ned, puas yog?

to sue you?
are you kidding?
you have done nothing wrong to me.
why should i?
fyi, unlike you, the word "sue" never cross my mind since i debate this issue with you.
unlike you, i don't have a dirty mind to sue anyone including you.
