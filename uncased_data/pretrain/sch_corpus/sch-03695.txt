yog koj hais lus zoo thiab lus ntse rau ces nkim koj cov qaub-ncaug xwb os.

hmoob, please do not hate each other it's time for us to understand one another we been lieing to long to our hmong people it's time to tell the truth and do what is right for our haiv hmoob, to me i think we are in a very confuse stage if you have the guts go to the country of laos and tell them that you want the laos to stop killing our brother and sisters.

dont talk anymore we need to use the united states to go in person sit with the lao goverment side by side ask them to help.

from now on dont hate your own kind.

at the end they will always be a hmong to you nothing can change that until they know the truth who is doing what and when.
thank you for your kind heart and caring in the hmong community.
any question fell free to contact me at any time.
