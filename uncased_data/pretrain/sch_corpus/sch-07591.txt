csy, all i can say is zaag nuav tsis zoo le zaag u lawm os puab yawm awd!

ob peb xyoo dhau los lawm thaum vp xa yawg nyiaj kaub vaj mus rau nplog hlais hauv dej nab khoom, lawv cov neeg tsev ua heev heev, vp twb tshee tshee yuav luag muaj heart attack ntawm nyiaj kaub lub living room nws cov tes taw thiaj tau muab nws nqa coj mus tsev lawm xwb.
zaum no mas fiv yeem kauv qaib los yuav pab tsis tau.
niaj hnub niam no luag nyuam qhuav pib luaj daim teb quav pwm tshis xwb, hnub twg luaj tag ces kawg raug ze taws hlawv ib tog tuaj lawm xwb.
thaum ntawd mas ntshai nplaim taws haj yuav cig loj...
ua zoo tsam nplaim taws ho lam kis tuaj kub nej tus puav nyob ze xwb los mas.

zhen: you are one pupil who have mastered my martial art without formal training.
why can't i have more pupils like you?

bruce lee proved to the world that the most effective martial art lies not with just kung-fu, tae-kwon-do, karate, but "jet-kun-do" which means free style - and that includes hmong's own fist.
i've seen bruce lee using his teeth effectively in a scene of "chinese connection."

charlie what is going on here?
where did you guys get all these news from...
did you guys actually spent your working time digging for these stuff?

im curious...

are hmong people that bored with all the good life we have here/ got nothing better to do but slaying each other right and left for a few ks of those government grants....
jesus christ!

i guess i would have to agrees with all those hypocrits out there and say go back to raise chicken....
hmong!
heheehe...
hmong would be happier with counting chickens then living in a normal society...
less tax and regulation for sure....

damn....
how disappointing!

no wonder why col.
lee tou pao coj nws cov qhab nab mus join dr.
lee pao yang lawv pab lawm ne.
