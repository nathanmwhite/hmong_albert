press release, news, theories, and informational items are to be nice beautiful and sweet.
just remember it is very likely just a trick to trap those so call rebels or anti-government citizens who had been tricked and had enough of bitter lpdr actions which came in as the result from those sweet things.
only count the real result.
any news about farm production.
just divide that by 10 and that is the real production result.
the other 9 factors is just to please higher up level leader.
it is the standard of commie lpdr.
if the lak got mad they scream and shout until everyone is on his/her knees begging.
therefore it is wise to make sure those news report is nice and sweet before it is out into the public.
just like those champion fighting ring all those dirty blood are clean up quickly before it turn into a negative impact for the official fight where the millions of $ are in the transaction any time there is a news release it is likely a direct announcement that there is a new trap waiting to eliminate the opponents or the citizens themselves.

one of the most important lesson is: commies and lpdr leaders are the grandmaster of ideas and tricks.
the evil begin at home first.
souphanouvong started by eliminating his brother so he can be up into the throne.

next lets see who will be the #1 in the politburo.
just hope no one is missing and the transfer process is sweet and clean.
i am positive that those grand master of ideas and tricks got it all planned out to do it sweet and cleanly to the eyes of the public.
the dirty and ugly things are iron out anf clean out with 100% certified ammonia cleaning solutions.
