brother, welcome back.
long time no see.

i agree that 'yawm saub' is not the creator, and i even add, nor is he/her a 'god'.
saub, is just a prophet, in my opinion.
yawm saub is a term coined later to revise hmong beliefs and creationism to be more in aligned with western religions.
note, in some creation dab neeg, tseem muaj tej tug hais, yawm saub puj saub, meaning, male saub and female saub.

raws li hmoob + suav ntseeg, peb ntseeg 'ntuj' or 'tian', which is just, in english, 'the heavens.
' yeej muaj ib zaj dab neeg kuv hnov, nws hais txog, 'theeb tsw' or 'theeb tswv', which, hais hauv lus suav yog, 'tian zhu'.
txhais rov hauv lus hmoob, 'tswv ntuj', or literally, 'ntuj tswv'.
nws yog the lord of the heaven.
zhu = tswv = lord, wang = vaj = king.
even hauv christianity, there are many kings, but only one lord.
lord = king of kings.

but, qhov kuv xav, hmoob lo lus, 'ntuj tsim teb raug', is also said in the dao de qing.
raws li dao (taoism, tao), ntseeg, ua ntej muaj 1, muaj qhov tsis muaj.
that is how i interpret, 'ntuj tsim teb raug.
' zhen, thanks for sharing your insights.
perhaps in place of "god" we could use "supernatural spiritual force"?

hauv zaj dab neeg es koj hnov, theeb tswv yog tshwm sim ua ntej dej nyab ntiaj teb los tom qab?

feel free to comment.

--lajntxiag people, yes, it is obvious that "yawm saub" didn't create the world according to hmong legends/myths..."
ntuj raug teb tsim...
yeeg quas yis li quav qaib, teb yeeg quas yi li quas us"...
suggest an "evolving" or "evolved" world, rather than a "created" world...
maybe this is something like genesis where it says "the world is without form"...???

however, nyob hauv zajtshoob (i'm sure lajntxiag kojyeej hnov zaj tshoob tsim tshoob no lawm)...
nws hais tias "ntuj tsi ruaj, teb tsi khov..
lub ntuj lub teb ua yeeg yoj li yiag taum roj, yeeg ywv li yiag taum fwv"...
in a way this could be the world was in its "gaseous" state....
ces "niam lajsab and txiv sabsua (not yawmsaub)" ho muab txiv nkauj qaub los tov...
es lub ntiajteb thiaj li khov...
and then land/ water forms from it.
hmoob qhov lub ntuj lub teb ces muaj li no xwb...
tsi hais txog yawmsaub li.

nyob hauv cov qeej, kuj tsi muaj ib zaj qeej tuav npe tias yog leejtwg tsim lub ntuj lub teb...
temsis nws hos hais tias "qaum ntuj tibneeg' no xwb.

hauv zaj qhuabke los kuj tsi tuavnpe tias leejtwg tsim...
cia li hais tias "puag thaum ub, ntuj raug teb tsim" no xwb...

hauv other myths los muaj ib cov hais tias "lub ntuj tsaus nciab li yiag txhiab..
tsaus nti li yiag ci..
ntuj nyob tsi ruaj, teb nyob tsi khov.."
(probably the hmong version of the bible introduced in china by missionaries??)
also, from cov stories uas kuv hnov, kuv tsuas yog hnov dej dag nyab ntiaj teb 1 zaug xwb....
zaj dabneeg "nkauj ntxhi chi and txiv nraug luj tub" do tell of the early people before the flood....
temsis for soem reason unknown to me, paj kaub cov tibneeg ho muab zaj dabneeg no hais mus txog tom dej dag nyob...
not only once..
but twice...

it seems, that yawmsaub is not a created...
but rather, a "life giver"....
his role in hmong legends/stores/myths los kuj tsi hais dabtsi txog tias nws tsim dabtsi..
but it does say that he gives life...

(ntawv noj ntawv haus).
yog haiv kev "thov" lawm, ces peb thov "ntuj" no xwb....
or in simpler term, maybe in simpler terms, lub ntuj yog "the creator" and lub "teb" yog the "created"...

however, it seems that the topic of this post "tries" to relate the "creator" as in the bible god to the hmong "creator"....
keep in mind, hmong religion has a different meaning of life when it comes to "religion"....
yawmsaub has no part in a hmong's life..
except thaum tuag xwb (reincarnation).
yog li no, to me, it is not important who created the world...
but how we view the world....

yaweh nej leej twg puas paub yajyig thiab yajyuam?
kuv pom muasnumtuam ib phau ntawv hais txof yajyig thiab yajyuam.
raws li hmoob zaj nkauj tsim ntuj tsim teb mas hais tias yog yajyig thiab yajyuam tsim no.

nej leej twg puas tau hnov dua thiab?
