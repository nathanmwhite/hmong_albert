who are extremely smart but yet brutal."

maybe you forgot that the world is not square anymore.
it is round.....
very round........
and people are entitle to their own opinions.........
if you cannot listen to what was said or is saying in sch then you are not ready to face the world.
you have a lot to grow up into.
the people in this world are very cruel.
you only have one family and one mother.
the only person who call you "mivnaib" is your mother.
