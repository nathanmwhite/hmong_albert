the guy is good. he pointed out how societies chose to fail through no
fault of their own. he mentioned easter island as one of the examples.
the people who lived in that island ended up resorting to cannibalism
to survive and of course nobody survived. and all the trees were
gone.
and yet, new societies fail to learn from the past. we as a human race
will keep repeating the same mistakes until the end of time.
