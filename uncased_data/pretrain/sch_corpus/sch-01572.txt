necessity is the mother of inventions. america doesn't need a bullet
train. it will need something else like electric cars.
now if china builds a bullet train linking mainland china to phuket
and singapore then it will mean economic progress for the whole
region. if that happens, i will ride it from vte to phuket and enjoy
patong beach.
