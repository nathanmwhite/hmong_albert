tug zoo kwvluag charlie, in order for the hmong to stand tall, we must be real when united.

what i have experienced the unity of the mong was that "we must united, but i am the head of the unit."
this mentality would never united the mong and we will never stand, my dear.

do not compare the mong to the israeli, either.
mong have no real politicians and we lack of diplomacy.
young or old, men or women think alike.
once i get a good position, i claim to be your leader and whatever you do, you must go thru me before going to the top.

otherwise, i would have nothing good to say about you.
it means that i would deny everything about you.
i could even report whatever i suspect you're doing without verifying the facts to the authority.
sad isn't it?

tawm sis, kuv zoo saab kws kuv pum mej suav dlawg nrug zoo saab haas taas, zaag nuav peb cov naam txiv kwv tij moob khuam tig thaib teb yuav tau tuaj taag taag le.
zaag kws thau puab tseem tsis tau paub taas lua yua qheb kev tog cov tuab neeg thojnaam tawg rog dlua ib zaag ntxiv, suav dlawg tshev ntau tsaav yaam.

ua dlej lua yuav paab moob, moob yuav tsum paab moob tug kheej ua dlej tsuav.
tsis yog haas taas, sawv dlawg sis tshum sis tshum haab sis dlaag sis dlaag kuam moob puas tsuaj taag.
kuv tseem nov haas taas, muaj tuab neeg moog dlaag kom puab txhob tuaj, twb yuav tau tebchaws taag taag le.
zaag nuav tsis yog kuv laam dlaag mej.
kuv cov tuabneeg txheeb ze tig u haas tuaj taas, yog vim le caag, suav dlawg twb haas taas kuam puab nyob twbywv tog.
zaag nuav, ho muaj ib co tuab neeg haas taas kom cale tuaj xwb xwb.
puab yuav ntseeg tus twg txhaaj yog tug haas lus tseeb?

now that everyone knows the fact that the impossible dream has ceased, they rush to the golden door for heaven.
who would be eligible for the resettlement program?
the door is only a few feet wide and people cannot squeeze thru it as they wish.
thau puab moog txug nraam gate, lua yuav txheeb puab npe zuj quas zug tes muaj coob tug yuav hlaa tsi dhau lub nrooj vaag zeb hov.

qhov nuav yog ib zaag lug haas lawv the "living bible" xwb.

hlubhmoob.
