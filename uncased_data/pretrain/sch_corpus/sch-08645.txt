lisnom ua tsaug!!!!!!
kuv ma xav los ntev heev lawm tabsis tsis paub yuav hais licas thiaj zoo.
muaj ib txhia yeej ua zoo kawg lawm thiab tabsis tseem muaj ib txhia hais luv phem heev li; xyov hnubtwg es hmoob thiajli yuav txawjxav ib yamnkaus.
txawm li ntawd los kuv twb pom tau tias cov coob yog cov zoo lawm tsuas yog muaj qho nyuag thiaj li tseem pheej ua dev raws nqaij thiab hais lus cuag li yus thiajli yog neeg xwb.
xyog nws puas yuav paub li ntawd thiab muaj qhov hwm lwmtus.
ua neeg nyob yog yus tsis hwm luag ces luag yeej tsis hwm yus ib yam.
in order to get some in return you must heavily invest yourself.
we could only reap what we saw but only take a part of the whole to see.

later, suabnoog the turning point is, grasp at the shadow and we may lose the substance.
there will always be some who will attack the people rather than tackling the issues.
txawm li cas los txhua yam yeej yuav nyob hauv no tsis ploj.
i believe what some of you have eloquently stated.

tus dev uas nws pheej dhia tas zog rau tus duab ntxoov ntxoo es tsis zeemtseeb txog daim nqaij ntawm nws qhovncauj will end up losing.

my fellow sch, it has been a great lesson for me, since i was here!
i have learned and became a custom many people wherever i may walked across, and to understand the richness and poorest quality of human behaviors and mentality.
this had uplift my wisdom, knowledge, intellectual, knowledge to another higher level.
thanks to all of you, whether you are the least expective or highly expective person.

next year, dr pao should come to july 4th or wisconsin labor fest to celebrate sch 11th year, with a tent over a table, so his colleauges and friends would stop by to say hi.

tsi tag li xwb, cov phem cov zoo los peb yuav tag, vim yog peb haivneeg hmoob lawm.
tus hais phem los, yus txhob nrog nws txua lus lawm ces ua ua nws tsi paub yuav ua dabtsi ntxiv lawm xwb, tsi tag li ntawv, yus coj yus tus kheej kom siab thiab more educate tshaj ntawv lawm es txhob nrog sib pib ces tsi muaj dabtsi!
niam no, peb tuaj nyob lub neej puv ntuj lawm, tus phem los yuav muaj, tus zoo los yuav muaj lawm, tabsi peb lub qhov muab twb pom kev mus deb tshaj ntawv lawm thiab--yog li peb saib peb tus kheej kom zoo tshaj ntawv ntxiv xwb-ces tau lawm.

every time you feel......
laugh 3 times, and then take a smile...
that will suit you good feelings!

born2behmong yhmonology, kuv paag yeej tsis tau swb ib zag le og, caij nyoog taag xwb, yog peb laam muaj ib ob teev tsis ce tsis muaj teebmeem le.
