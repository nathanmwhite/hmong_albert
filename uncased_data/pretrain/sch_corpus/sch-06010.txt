tej nyuag xwm zej zog no ces tso siab rau koj lawm.
koj hais yog.
the race card is a dangerous card to play in chai's case.
this is a hunter versus other hunters.
chai vang happened to be hmong.
that's all.
hmong ain't chinese, koreans, nor japanese.
hmong muaj nqis rau the us ten times that of these other asians if we played the right card.

gvp would've said to you this way.
ya, "nyob pem ko nrog xyuas nawb tej nyuag teeb meem me, me lino xwb tsis tas kuv yuav tuaj."
i second!
