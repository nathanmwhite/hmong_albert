china made a good move.
she can afford to do it because she has funds.

spending 12% on r&d is big.

does china still have cronyism issue?
maybe not anymore.
a more intelligent and talented work force with less ideology will translate into a faster pace of development for the country.

by the end of the 21st century, china is expected to be a full-fledged super power.
