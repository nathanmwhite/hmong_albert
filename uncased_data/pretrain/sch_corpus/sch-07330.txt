thanks, pao lo for sharing your feeling regarding the issue above.
i sense that a young innoscent hmong leader is being attack from both sides (left and right) to make you respond like this.
don't let these dirty attack weaken you, yawm yij.
instead any negative attack should make you stronger.

koj tus kheej thiab txoj kev hlub txog yus haiv neeg hmoob yeej tseem dawb huv tab sis yog tus neeg los pab neeg (zoov khaab) uas koj mus koom ntawd muaj lub hom phiaj destructive ces koj qhov participation yeej kho tsi tau hlo es ib txhia thiaj li ceebtoom kom koj tsi txhob mus koom zoo dua.

i also second maina's view regarding this forum.

have nice day, pdy
