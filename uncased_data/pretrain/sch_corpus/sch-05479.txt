yaweh,
puas muaj phem zoo os?  phem kawg phem xwb.  zoo ces zoo xwb.
txiv npawv rau qhov zoo, ncaj, tib neeg feem coob pom zoo thiab yuav
tau, muab vajtswv txoj kev ncaj ua tus qauv taug.
vajtswv taug paus tis ntis, yeej weigh txaus lawm, maam teem txim rau.
yaweh txais nrab xwb, yaweh thiaj yuav tau, cov ntsuas paus ti ntsi
think high think low, see bottom see top, lawv paub tias qhov twg yog.

mesnyuam dluag,
thaum luas has lug tseeb tuaj ces kawg hle rig xwb puas yog?  i arrest
my case.  what i said about the name yaweh are all facts.  go ahead and
look it up yourself.  i f you are afraid of the truth then just take my
words for it.

le caag los qhov tseeb will always remain.  hab has lug rua koj nwg
