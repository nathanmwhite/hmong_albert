ib tsoom npojyaig, kwvluag:
yog peb coob leej xeev xwm txaus mas kuv ntseeg tas 30 xyoo dlhau lug
peb moob miskas yeej txawm muaj millionairs coob tshaaj le peb muaj
lawm. kuv nov muaj peb ib yawm xeev txwj kws nwg nyav tso lub ntlaj
teb tseg tsi ntev lug nuav tau invest ib thaaj aav kwv yeem 40 acres.
thaum nwg yuav, kwv yeem 13-14 xyoos dlhau lug, yog under $100,000.00.
taam sim nuav raug nqe tshaaj $2 million dollars. dlua le ntawd coob
leej kuj made fortune ntawm kev invest rua aav. it is something we
aught to think about seriously, isn't it?
nyob zoo xyoo tshab,

nyob zoo tsav,
yog mas. kuv ntseeg has tas tsi yog peb hmoob xwb, lwm haiv neeg los
yeej ib yaam nkaus. tawm sis muaj qee leej, qee pawg luas lub nam
tswvyim txawv yug cov majority ces luas txhaj le nplua nuj taag moog
le.
kuv muaj ib tug distant cousin who came to origon and his sponsor
persuaded him to buy a home which he did. a couple years later he
wanted to move to fresno for welfare benefit and reunited with
relatives. because his family was very large, therefore, a couple
years in the house caused so much deterioration for the property. he
tried to sell it for more than a year without a prospective buyer.
finally he gave it back to the bank. when i met him in the mids 80s in
fresno and he said that he would never buy home any more.
nevertheless, i strongly believe that with good disciplines and well
oriented goal in mind a person can become a millionair in his/her life
time in this country with proper investment. the problem is that most
ordinary people do not have good disciplines and good goal in their
life.
tseem tsi tau lig rau peb hlo li. peb twb pom tseeb lawm tias tau 30
xyoo los no lub teb chaws no huam vam npaum li cas ntxiv. qhov no yuav
tsum ua pov thawj zoo rau peb thiab ntaus peb lub siab kom ruaj lawm
tias yog yus ua siab ntev yuav tsev, yuav av cia ces muaj ib hnub yus
cov nyuas nyiaj me me ntawd yuav cia li tawg paj ntau caum npaug ntxiv
xwb. peb ib tsoom kwv tij hmoob- especially our generation- yog ib co
neeg uas txawj txuag nyiaj heev as compare to others. ua luam lwm yam
mas peb tsi tau txawj ces yuav kov tsi yeej luag tab sis yog muab
nyiaj log hauv av li hais los saum no mas kuv ntseeg hais tias peb
sawv daws yuav tsum sawv nrog luag muaj nyiaj xwb xwb. just my
thought.
have a happy new year,
ms
