good work.
now you earn my respect for doing such good research.
let's hear from teev.

ms to all hmong bro and sis i think everyone can use as many screen name as s/he wanted and be able to remember his/her own screen names and passwords, there is no limited of how many screen name we can or can't use.
as long as we don't steal anybody else screen name and password there should be no problem, the internet has a lot of room for us to poop.
