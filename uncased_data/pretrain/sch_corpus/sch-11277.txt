cov yawg aw-- don't waste your time and breath.
i know i won't.
tam sim no nplog liab muaj qhov policy hais tias, "ua txoj tsis hnov, tsis pom, tsis paub, tsis mob, tsis khaus" no lawm nas.
like i have been saying all along, you can bark all you want, it is not going to hurt them or make them change anything.
not even the un and us can do a thing to make the lpdr change anything.
