is sibtham really col.
tou lue's son?
it is not a big surprise that he acts alike his father after knowing who he is and what background he came from.
i think sibtham is a reasonable man before but now i am not sure any more.

hey guys, menyuam nom hmoob tim loojceeb, tsis hais thaum ub los ziag no, yeej nyiam hais lus loj-j li sibtham hais no.
give the guy a chance to further explain his claim that gvp is the most advanced invention hmong invented in laos.

sibtham, as a son to a well known col.
, you need to stick with your principle.
thus, please elaborate us more of your reason(s) why you think gvp is the most advanced invention hmong created.
as i try to catch up with reading all posts in this thread, i found that your later posts have some contradictions but i don't want to jump into those posts yet before i see your list of how you qualify gvp as the most advanced invention hmong made.
hint: a most advanced invention can be good, bad, or ugly, so just be straight per your claim.
until then, the more you talk, the more you will discredit your claim.
- hide quoted text - - show quoted text -- hide quoted text - - show quoted text - sibtham, of course, it is freedom of speech.
that's why you are entitled to express whatever you want to.
in this case, you claimed that gvp is the best invention hmong produced in laos.

it is too bad that i can't feel the same way you feel toward vp.
to me, vp is a respectful leader as any other hmong leader.
that's why i ask you to provide us your qualification list of vp.
hint: an ibm computer can't be named the most advanced invention technology without its high qualities, such as its hardware, software, capability, performance, etc.
, don't you agree?
so what are vp's qualities?
just stick to the point!
