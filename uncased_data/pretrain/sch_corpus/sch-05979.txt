hello there, my fellow hmong brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, grandpa, grandma, nieces and nephews.
it is my pleasure to be in here and have the chance to read all the posts.
this kind of wordings war is not new.
it's same old thing "words" a decate ago when gvp's and dyd's followers started to make war with wordings with each other like dog and cat.

some are having fun (me) and some are very sensitive(offended)to what others say about his/her brainwasher.
i feel bad for those who have been brainwashed by gvp and dyd.
these vulnerable people had gave away thunsands of dollar to buy their ranking from gvp and for dyd to have good vacations in oversea because they think they will get some good results in return.
unfortunately, these people got heartach at the end.

my dearly hmong people if have some money in your pocket but you don't know what to do with it, just invest your money with a conservative account at a bank.
i'm sure you will see a good result plus smile face in the future instead of being feeling disappointed that your leader is betray/ or be a traitor on you.
