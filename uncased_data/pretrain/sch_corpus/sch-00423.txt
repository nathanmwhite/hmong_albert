that is very interesting, a play on word to bring out the multiple definitions of a single word.
however, what i am seeking for is not in definitions, but in part of speech.

qhov kuv xaav paub yog ib lulug yuav muaj peevxwm yog tau ntau hom los yog cov npe rua ntawm cov part of speech hov ntau npaum le caag dlag.
qhov kws yuav nrhav kuam ib lulug es yog tau ob hom tes kuj tsi nyuaj heev, tamsis kuv xaav paub tas peb muaj cov lug kws yog ntau tshaaj ob hom ntawm cov npe rua huv cov part of speech nuav ntau heev npaum le caag tag.
pevxaam tas lulug taum, nwg yog noun rua bean, hab yog verb rua poke, to poke at something, tes taum yog tau ob hom lawm.
es taum puas yuav muaj peevxwm yog tau adjective, adverb, interjection los yog lwm yaam ntxiv ntawm ob yaam kws peb pum tau tseeb tas taum tub yog lawm?
kuv muab cab coj lug saib ua ntej, vim cab yog noun, verb, hab interjection, es lwm lulug kws muaj peevxwm yog tau peb yaam lawv le cab nuav ne, cov lug hov yog lulug twg los yog dlaabtsi?
dlawb puas yuav yog peb yaam tau?
dlawb kws yog noun, npe rua tuabneeg, dlawb kws yog adjective qha tas yaam xim hov yog xim dlaabtsi, hab dlawb kws yog adjective qha tas yaam hov tsi taag them nqe rua, tau dlawb xwb.
dlawb tub yog ob yaam adjective dlag, es dlawb puas yuav yog tau adverb hab--nyob dlawb xwb, tsi ua num dlaabtsi le?
xaav kuam mej paab tawm tswvyim tuaj ntxiv saib cov lug kws peb muaj es yog tau ntau tshaaj ob hom/yaam los ob lub npe rua ntawm cov part of speech yog lulug twg ntxiv.

moob lajleeb if you're referring to a [specific] "noun," or "verb," or "preposition," or "adjective," or "adverb," so on and so forth ---- whether as a collection of terms or as part of a sentence --- and ask what *position* that particular term/word plays with respect to the rest, in a sentence...
then, yes, it makes sense.

hlao has yog lawn.
