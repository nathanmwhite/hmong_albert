friends,
most of us agreed to use "vag" as webpage. how about computer = tshuab
hlwb = hlwb hlau.
hauv hmoob tuam tshoj qab teb lub vag, lawv siv lo lus tshuab hlwb hos
hauv hmoob mem kuj ib pab neeg txhais yeeb yaj duab siv hlwb hlau. nej
xav hais tias peb yuav siv lo twb zoo dua, los yog yuav siv
khauspivdawm (khaus piv dawm = khosm phiu dawmr)?

good news xeng i 100% agree with ceev pov too that the way it should
be done or do. btw "computer is computer" i dont want to know what it
means in hmong.
today we prefer to use english as #1 international language, not
chinese, not pajanese, not mexican, not russian. even my 80 years old
mother still say it is a computer.

how about "tsev vas" for "homepage"?  check out this link.
