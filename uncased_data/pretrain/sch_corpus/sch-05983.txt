dr.
yang dao must not take possession of the medal that the usa goverment gave to the hmong in colorado as thank u for helping the cia, and the war in laos.
it didn't belong to dr.
yang dao.
it belong to the hmong and he shoud display it in somewhere such as museum so most hmong can go and see it.
as of now, dr.
yang dao only keep in his house and take possession of the medal.
it doesn't belong to dr.
yang dao but the hmong as a whole.
if he keeps it there for a long time and after he die, his family would keep it and other hmong would not get to see it.

as of right now, only those that yang dao welcome get to see it and everytime someone come to his house he always brag that it is his medal this and that.
that is not right.
he has nothing to do with the war in laos and it doesn't belong to him.
what do u people think?
