pov lis: if you believed so strongly that those hmong in the jungle will be safer by surrending, why don't you and teev move hnd over to vientiane and look after their well being.
you taunted sibhlub of his rhetorics in sch without even realizing that you, too, are subjective to condemnation.
i have a suggestion for you and please end this pointless debate once and for all.
koj txawj muay tai-chi (muay muag tabsis ntaus mob, mob ces koj yeej meem siv koj txuj).
sib hlub txawj muay hmong (ntaus pig poog - tig toog xwb los nov yog hmoob tug).

tsuav peb ntaus ib tug yeej ncuab xwb ces yeej tsis txhaum.
qhov kuv tsis xav pom mas yog neb pheej rov sib ntaus neb es luag khaws luag xwb.

tsaav!
