no xeng, it is not 1% hmong population and 70% hmong produces.
according to the guy mention in the video it is about 10% hmong
population and they are able to produce about 60% of argricultural
produces to the market. hmong produces are fresher and look tastier
than those make from the native french (black) peoples'. that's why
hmong market are more attractive to the buyers.
