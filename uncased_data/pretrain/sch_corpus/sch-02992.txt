nyobzoo hnubkaj, ntxim zoo le koj paub zoo txug xabmaim looj ceeb zoo hujsim.
yog lawm, thaus kuv nov txug puab cov coj nyob tom lao huam phao thaam txug cov ntxhais xavaddee karn tod mas puab tau zoo ua tagx.
tej ntxhais tuaj ua haujlwm tod ces yog coj tuaj rua cov thawjcoj ua lev pua xwb las as...

nyob zoo xyoo tshab ms ms, tej kev uas cov nom tswv thaud tau quab yuam luag tej ntxhais ua dev ua npua los sis ua niam yau no mas peb cov pojniam twb tsis tau muab hais tawm kiag li nawb.
ua ib tug pojniam mas koj raug luag rape los koj yeej txhaum, koj raug yuam ua niam yau los koj yeej swb tag li xwb vim lub ntuj qub qab, tej txiv neej yeej muaj xiv.
dhau ntawd yog tseem yog nom tswv thiab ces lawv yog nqis kiag ntawm lub ntuj lub teb xwb ces ib tug nyuag pojniam lub neej twb tsis muaj nqi npaum ib daim ntaub so ko taw.

thaum ub kuv tseem hluas thiab ruam mas kuv pom cov ntxhais savadikarne los sis lao luam phao mas kuv xav tias cov no yog cov pojniam/hluas nkauj tsis tsim txiaj tiag vim lawv deev luag txiv thiab ua luag niam yau.
dhau ntawd muaj ib txhia tseem hais tias cov no mas yog meb cab xwb.
peb lub hmong society thaud qhia kom yus xav mus li ntawd ces qas pojniam txiv neej sawvdaws look down on these girls.

thaum kuv paub tab thiab pom kev deb zog tuaj kuv thiaj mam to taub tias cov ntxhais no tsuas yog nrhiav kev khwv noj khwv haus thiab survive in an impossible male dominated society.
consider this - koj niam/txiv yug tau ib pab ntxhais xwb, liaj teb tsis muaj ua vim muaj tsov muaj rog, what opportuntities did these girls have?
many hoped to attract a young hmong man so they will be married before being raped or forced to marry a married man.
some were lucky but many more were not.

anyway, tham tsawg los sawvdaws yeej paub ntau lawm vim tej no happened in front of everyone's eyes.
can you imagine being a woman, was raped by stranger and then forced to marry the rapist?
or being 13-14 years old and was forced to marry a married man in his 30-50s?
i heard horrible story of young new bride who kept fighting her husband and ended up being tied to the bed so her husband can have sex with her.
there are also those girls who were so disgusted with their husband and his sexual abuse that they committed suicide.

so, where am i going with this?
i just want to clarify that my mention of lao luam phao girls is not to further disgrace them but to remind everyone of the "sins" of our fathers as well as our own so that mistake will not repeat itself for the sake of our children and future generation.
thanks for reading.
