they think they can make a difference in people's life......

they have delusional grandeur....

anybody can succeed slowly.

all they have to do is get a job or start a business..

and then accumulate slowly.

anybody can do that!

there is nothing unique about slow success!

therefore, delusional godly bitches need to quit and leave people alone!!!!

i don't hardly see miracles anywhere!

therefore, quit smoking thinking you are so godly!!!!

where is your great miracle or miracles to establish your godliness?

you cannot establish yourself, then quit smoking so much!!!!!!!

and don't come around here acting smart taking credit for people's success!!!!!
