phooj ywg txawjua: nothing is wrong when sys called laura xiong ms.
the american people usually use ms rather than mrs.
please don't get the wrong idea.

phooj ywg e, paub tias koj txawj ua lawm los mas.
hehehehehe....

============================================== hmoobnplog hais yog lawm thiab los mas txawj ua!
using ms.
instead of mrs.
, like sys did, is a polite way to address someone you are not so sure of their marital status.
