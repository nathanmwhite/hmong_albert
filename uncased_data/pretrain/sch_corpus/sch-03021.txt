i have watched some of the hmong movies.
before they don't really hold close to one another but now hmong movies has become more modernized, that is holding hands, holding to one another tightly, sleep together, ib leeg tig los puag los khawm ib leeg thiab tseem muaj kissing lawm thiab!
wow!

i'm curious, yog nej tsis tau muaj txiv los yog muaj pojniam, would you consider marrying a hmong movie star uas twb muaj neeg muab nws puag puag los lawm thiab perhaps twb muaj tug muab nws kiss los lawm?

would you?
why or why not?

nkauj mim, that means hmong has become a real movie star!
in any movie, there are so many scenes - fighting, crying, yelling, kissing and even love making.
people enjoy these types of movies.
hmong movies are still way far behind, well, i mean in terms of love making scenes.
i want to see more of love scenes, perhaps a pg-13, i'm not ready for a r rated or x rated yet.
kuv hnov tias kuj muaj lawm thiab, tabsis tsis tau pom dua.

rau kuv xwb mas, tau xwb, tau kawg.
yog kuv tus pojniam yog ib tug movie star lawm ces nws yuav khawm petsawg leej los tsis ua cas, vim nws tsuas yog act raws li qhov script thiab ua kom zaj movie ntawd lom zem xwb.
li cas los thaum los txog tsev ces nws yeej yog kuv tug thiab yog txhua yam yog kuv li lawm.
yog kiss li movie hmoob xwb ces tsuas kiss me...
me...
ntawm lub nyuas phlu xwb twb tsis yog hot kiss ces tsis ua cas.

tau kawg.

this is my recommendation for any hmoob movie star or singer.

yog koj tseem xav ua movie ces tsis txhob yuav txiv/pojniam kav tsis ua koj cov dej num kom tiav tso.
so too many of them have fight almost any day.
tsis yog hmoob xwb, lwm yam tib neeg los yeej muaj teebmeem ib yam thiab.
only few are realistickly flacible muaj family thiab still act.
if you choose this way let it be this way are much better that you end up wonder what you going to do with your family.

i think peb hmoob niam qhuav pib meme xwb, our movie maker don't make enought money to make it big yet, it was good but not yet perfect.

tosli tej niag movie stars es sibnrauj pawg peslug nyob rau hollywood ces vim tej no ntag.
nws mag lwmtus puag dhau los ces pheej xav tias ntshe tseem muaj tus yuav haibdua thiab.
sim lawm ces xav saj, saj lawm ces xav noj ntag.

hmong is falling into the trend and you can see these days many of our hmong singers, actors and actresses are not so far behind on being famous, infamous, divorce, and other things.

kuamemiab ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- hmoob lub neej tseem mus tsis tau txog tej no.
yog peb yuam ua kom hais tias yus ua tau thiab no ces yus txawm ua tau los yuav tsis phim thiab tsis zoo li luag.

thiab nws yuav tsis raug haiv neeg hmoob nyiam.
mam xyaum mam ua qhov me me mus ua ntej tso, txhob rawm hla hlo mus.

ntuj..
