sys,
you know what? an old lady came to my store and said this:
-" ua lawv tsaug os me tub...yog lawv tsis ntuas koj ua luaj no
ces ntshe koj lub neej twb tsis zoo li no os mog." then she left.
-"...huh????" astonished, i stood there speechless for a long moment...
life is too short, my wife is too beautiful, so many places yet  to be
explored....
