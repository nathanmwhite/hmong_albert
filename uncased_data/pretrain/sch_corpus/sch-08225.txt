fajkhaum,
thank you for the information.
hais txog ntawm peb cov ntseeg.  ua li cas lwm haiv neeg yuag ntseeg ab
tsi los leejtwg yeej tsis twv.  ua cas cov ntseeg yexus yuav raug lub
txim nyav ualuaj.  tej yam li no yeej muaj teev tseg nyob rau hauv
vajtswv txoj lus lawm hais tias tibneeg yuav ntxub thiab yuam tsim peb
vim yog peb ntseeg tus tswv yexus.  matthew 5:11-12, "blessed are you
when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil
against you because of me.  rejoice and  be glad, because great is your
reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who
were before you."
cov lus ua hais tas los nov yog tswv yexus cov lus ua nws tau hais
tseg.  twb vim li ntawd, cov ntseeg thiaj ua siab nyiaj txoj kev tsim
txom vim tus tswv tub paub lawm haistias tibneeg yuav ntxub ntxo peb
vim peb yog vajtswv cov menyuam.
john 15:18-19 tswv yexus hais txiv haistias, "if the world hates you,
keep in mind that it hated me first.  if you belonged to the world, it
would love you as its own.  as it is, you do not belong to the world,
but i have chosen you out of the world.  that is why the world hates
you."
