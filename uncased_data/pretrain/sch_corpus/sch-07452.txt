is this a perfect example of mong tsi hlub moob?

i heard, only i heard, and no proof.

in sacto, there was a child.
this child yog ibtug mivnyuas haav zoov,.
nwg tau taag simneej.
nwg cov grand parents tsi kaam paam - ua ib lub nteeg rua nwg.
they asked the church to arrange funeral services for the person.

moob tsi pub paam tuag huv ibleeg tug twg lub tsev rua qhov nyob tsaam "txhum moob le dlaabqhua".
twb tsi yog paam tuag xwb tabsis coj nyaab tshab lug xwb los twb tsi tau.
is it txhum moob le dlaab qhua los yog txhum "moob"?

cov moob lawbdlaab are ready and already been doing, by open their house rua any family, txawv dlaabqhua, moog paam tuag losis coj nyaab tshab moog rua huv puab tsev.
if by lawbdlaab moob is able to do or share limitless of other things with friends and neighbors then shall we agree that lawbdlaab is a better approache to humanity than tsi lawbdlaab?
