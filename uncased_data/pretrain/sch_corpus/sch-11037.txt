 will you distinguish the difference between a son and a daughter--which one you would be willing to support more?
 or will you say that spoiling them by by being the provider for them to fall back on will only create more spoilages?
 if i could do it, struggling through hard work and determination on my own to get to where i am today, they should be able to do the same--i'm leading by example.

moobthaibteb aw, there's a big difference between support and spoil ov.
kuv muaj ib niag relative mas nwg tsis pub nwg niag tub ua hauj lwm kiag li ces nws them nuj nqe puas tsav yam rau tug tub hov kawm tiav ba lawm tab sis nyuag tub hov mas nrhiav hauj lwm nyuaj kawg kiag.
thaum kawg ces lam mus nrug lawv ua hauj lwm dog dig xwb tiag.
hos muaj ib tig kwv tij mas nws tsua pab miv nstiv xwb ces nwg tug tub yuav tsum tau qiv loan los them school thiab books tuab si.
niam thiab txiv yug mov thiab pub lub nyuag lum fai qub x tsua caij mus kawm ntawv xwb.
thaum kawm tiav, yawm nov ho tau hauj lwm rau nws field thiab tau nyiaj ntau dua.
koj ces yog li yawm thib 2 no ntag laud.
be proud of your achievement!
tej no tsis yog niamtxiv tsis hlub yus, yog lawv cob qhia kom yus paub ua neej independently xwb mog.

peace, hk
