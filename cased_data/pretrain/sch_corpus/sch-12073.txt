THE GUY IS GOOD .
HE POINTED OUT HOW SOCIETIES CHOSE TO FAIL THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN .
HE MENTIONED EASTER ISLAND AS ONE OF THE EXAMPLES .

THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THAT ISLAND ENDED UP RESORTING TO CANNIBALISM TO SURVIVE AND OF COURSE NOBODY SURVIVED .
AND ALL THE TREES WERE GONE .

AND YET , NEW SOCIETIES FAIL TO LEARN FROM THE PAST .
WE AS A HUMAN RACE WILL KEEP REPEATING THE SAME MISTAKES UNTIL THE END OF TIME .
