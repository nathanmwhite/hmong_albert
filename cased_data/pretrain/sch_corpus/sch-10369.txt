Pure Hmong , why are you mad about this hmong new year issue ?
dont you know that most of the people that are running these new years were our older brothers and sisters who were at dongdok and lycee in the 60 & 70 era .
and , many of them were here in SCH with you and me ...

again , because our hmong people cannot take any critic and will not learn from his/her own mistakes that that is the very reason that we are where we are ....
LOL !
