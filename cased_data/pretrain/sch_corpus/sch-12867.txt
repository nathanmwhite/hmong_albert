Hmong75 , Sorry for jumping in .
I am not one of those you directed your question to , but I think a most likely answer would be , something like " Xyoo 19__ or 200_ no ces peb yuav tsum tau lub teb chaws xwb xwb li .

Sawvdaws yeej yuav tau rov mus nyob nyias teb nyias chaw xwb ."
In the past twenty plus years every time one asked , this is the likely answer .
Don ' t expect anything different this time as well .

Ops !
I talked too much .
Better stop now , tsam ces tau kua nceb haus .

- Cha .
