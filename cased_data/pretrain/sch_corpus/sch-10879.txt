WHAT A MIRACLE , THEY ARE EMBARRASSED IN TWO STRAIGHT GAMES , AND IN THE 3RD GAME , BRAZIL DEFEATS ITALY 3 - 0 AND USA DEFEATS EGYPT 3 - 0 TO ADVANCE , NOW WE WILL PLAY SPAIN , NO EASY FEAT .

THIS IS LIKE MIRACLE ON ICE , GAME OF THEIR LIVES , BIGGEST ODDS POSSIBLE .

excuse the caps , exciting ...
