Yag Hawj,
Kuv xaav paub tas peb ib tsoom Moob kws tseem coj kev cai qub puas
muaj lub chaw pe hawm hab puas muaj txuj kev ntseeg lug qha rua lwm
haiv kom luas kawm yug tej txuj ci hab, yog tag zoo tag-g le koj has,
es koj tseem kom kuv find out for myself who I am ces mean tas koj
nrhav tsi tau qhov ntawd le, lub chaw pe hawm tug Tswv.
Zoo,
I knew that Jesus had been critiqued and tortured to carry and die at
the CROSS because human's sin. There are many Satanic would try to use
the devil's sword to kill us by calling Jesus as a baster and the
Christian as a conveter. But we will never feel to denounce our
believing.
