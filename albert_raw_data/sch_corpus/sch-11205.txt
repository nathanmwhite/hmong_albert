THIS CHINESE PROVERB BRINGS LUCK.  IT ORIGINATED FROM THE NETHERLANDS.
THIS PROVERB HAS GONE AROUND THE WORLD 8 TIMES.  NOW IT IS YOUR TURN
TO HAVE GOOD LUCK ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED IT.
THIS IS NOT A JOKE
YOUR LUCK WILL ARRIVE BY MAIL OR VIA THE INTERNET
SEND A COPY TO THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED LUCK. DO NOT SEND MONEY,
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BUY LUCK, AND DO NOT KEEP IT FOR MORE THAN 4 DAYS.
ONE MAN, GOT HIS FIRST COPY OF THE PROVERB IN 1953 AND ASKED HIS
SECRETARY TO MAKE HIM 20 COPIES.  NINE HOURS LATER HE WON $99 MILLION
IN THE LOTTERY IN HIS COUNTRY.  AN EMPLOYEE OF HIS RECEIVED THE SAME
CARD, BUT DID NOT FORWARD IT.  A FEW DAYS LATER HE LOST HIS JOB.
AFTER THAT, HE CHANGED HIS MIND, SENT IT, AND BECAME RICH.  IN 1967,
ANOTHER MAN GOT THE PROVERB; HE LAUGHED ABOUT IT AND DISCARDED IT. A
FEW DAYS LATER HIS SON GOT SICK.  THE MAN LOOKED FOR THE NOTE, MADE 20
COPIES, AND SENT THEM. NINE DAYS LATER, HE GOT GOOD NEWS: HIS SON WAS
SAFE AND SOUND.
