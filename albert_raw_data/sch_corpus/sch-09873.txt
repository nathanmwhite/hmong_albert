Roger! I have revealed my id publically before. You are entitled you

You disagree, that's ok. But you also need to provide your explantion.
I believe I am reasonable. When somebody goes out of line on me and
can't just stand still. My exchange with thorn is words for words. You
may review the exchange if you wish.
Read my reply to teev about my position. If you can't still understand

Concerning me, we can do it right here in SCH. Both of us are already
here.
Please, the floor is your. I'll follow your rule.
Concerning my family, as you still show respect for fairness then I am
greatful to your proposal. I believe you will commit to your words.
You name the place and we will agree on a reasonable time frame that
suitable for both you and him. We will make sure that both of you have
the security. We can do the Hmong way or the Americain way. Serious
subject must be dealt with care and given ample of opportunity to both
parties. The choice is your.

Interesting discussion.
Is Sibtham really col. Tou Lue's son?  It is not a big surprise that
he acts alike his father after knowing who he is and what background
he came from. I think Sibtham is a reasonable man before but now I am
not sure any more.
Hey guys, menyuam nom Hmoob tim Loojceeb, tsis hais thaum ub los ziag
no, yeej nyiam hais lus loj-j li Sibtham hais no. Give the guy a
chance to further explain his claim that GVP is the most advanced
invention Hmong invented in Laos.
Sibtham, as a son to a well known col., you need to stick with your
principle. Thus, please elaborate us more of your reason(s) why you
think GVP is the most advanced invention Hmong created. As I try to
catch up with reading all posts in this thread, I found that your
later posts have some contradictions but I don't want to jump into
those posts yet before I see your list of how you qualify GVP as the
most advanced invention Hmong made. HINT: a most advanced invention
can be good, bad, or ugly, so just be straight per your claim. Until
then, the more you talk, the more you will discredit your claim.- Hide quoted text -

Sibtham,
Of course, it is freedom of speech. That's why you are entitled to
express whatever you want to. In this case, you claimed that GVP is
the best invention Hmong produced in Laos.
It is too bad that I can't feel the same way you feel toward VP. To
me, VP is a respectful leader as any other Hmong leader. That's why I
ask you to provide us your qualification list of VP. HINT: an IBM
computer can't be named the most advanced invention technology without
its high qualities, such as its hardware, software, capability,
performance, etc., don't you agree? So what are VP's qualities? Just
stick to the point!
