cov yawg aw-- don't waste your time and breath.  I know I won't.  tam
sim no nplog liab muaj qhov policy hais tias, "Ua txoj tsis hnov, tsis
pom, tsis paub, tsis mob, tsis khaus" no lawm nas.  like i have been
saying all along, you can bark all you want, it is not going to hurt
them or make them change anything.  not even the UN and U.S. can do a
thing to make the lpdr change anything.
