IF THERE'S EVER A WAR BETWEEN CHINA AND VIETNAM, IT WILL PLAY NICELY
INTO THE AMERICAN HANDS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MOTIVES FOR AMERICA TO
GET INVOLVED INTO THIS CRAP FOR ONE, AMERICA AS A COUNTRY HAS NEVER
SHIED AWAY FROM A WAR OF ANY SORT, ON THE CONTRARY THIS COUNTRY HAS
WON TWO MAJOR WORLD WARS, HAS STARTED A FEW WARS OF ITS OWN MAKING AND
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT A BETTER WAY TO ERASE THE NATIONAL DEBT. WAR
MAKES MONEY.
