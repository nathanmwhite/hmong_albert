Base on the leak and country of origin of the leak, the individual may
have acted upon the intsruction of the host country while visiting,
lao. Another word, the individual is an instrument of that instructor,
whoever that maybe, most likely lpdr official and very likely
conspired by them since we have now learned that there was no such
activity taking place.
If the individual in concern learned about the activity in the US and
was concern about the consequence it will bring to the Hmong as a
whole he/she will act while is in this country and most likely will
consult with his peers, hmong intellectyals, educators prior take
action. This action will most like less damaging to all parties.
My view at this time is, the individual was in Vientian at the time of
the leak and origin of the leak that mean the idividual learned about
the info while is there whether by accident or by intend or by being
used as a mean to deliver the message and failed to verify.
Muab ntsia los mas ntxim zoo li thaum tus tibneeg no mus txog hauv
Vientianbe, nws mam li mus paub thiab hnov cov xov  xwmtxheej no. Yog
tsi li ntawd nws yuav tsi coj mus tso tawm tawm hauv Vientiane rov
tuaj. Qhiov question loj mas puas yog nws raug nplog liab ntxia dag
txog qhov xwmtxheej no thiab kom nws yuav tsum coj qhov xwmtxheej no
mus hais rua US authority vim nplogliab ntseeg tias yog nws hais US
yuav ntseg nws thiab take action.
Peb paub qhov WHEN AND WHERE LAWM. peb ho tig los xyuas qhov WHY.
1. Raug muas tau lawm
2. Raug yuam
3. Mob siab ntawm nws tus kheej, muaj kev hlub tshua txog Hmoob ntshai
tsam muaj kev paus tsuaj loj rau haib neeg Hmoob.
Yog nws paub qhov xov no thiab mob sia thiab hlub tshua tsam muaj kev
puas ntsoog loj rau haiv neeg Hmoob ntxim nws yauv sablaj rau nw cov
advisors, tubtxawj ntxhais ntse nrog nws nrhiav tswvyim los daws. Los
puas yog nws xav tias Hmoob cov neeg txawj ce kawg nws tib leeg lawm
xwb thiaj li tsi sablaj rau leej twg li thiaj ua nws ib leeg lawm xwb?
Puas yog nws twb sablaj rau nws cov advisor tag lawm, xws lis
Noogqejqawg, yawg thiaj sawv los defend li tau posted saumtoj no?

Zoo,
Ua tsaug rua koj tej zeemmuag (perspectives) koj tau faib. Has hab nug
le koj mas txhaj le muaj kev pheej xeeb rua suav dlawg.
Kom mej suav dlawg to taub has tas kuv tsi yog ib tug tub txawg tub
ntse. Tsi taag le ntawd, kuv yeej tsi txuam yuaj los sis involve nrug
pawg twg including DYD. Yog le ntawd mas kuv yeej tsi paub dlaab tsi
hlo. Qhov kuv tau lug post cov posts in opposition rua suav dlawg txug
qhov leak nuav mas yog kuv muab saib suav dlawg ab lam DYD dlhau nrim
heev lawm. Kuv xaam pum tas coj le ntawd mas peb Hmoob yuav muaj tsi
taug kev humxeeb ruaj hab khov. Yog le mas kuv txhaj le post tej yaam
kuv xaam pum lug rua suav dlawg luj xwb. Yog kuv paub txug tej intent
of the Operation Popcorn es kuv muaj strong opposition rua qhov intent
ntawd mas kuv xum approach pawg neeg ntawd privately. I am not a
person with deep and extensive knowledge in politics so, I would not
use wistle blowing as a resort. But I think and doubt someone who see
thing through might do that in order to prevent something he/she view
as dangerous.
