it has been more than 10 years.....
what do u call bitches that cannot pay up??
slow, old, senile, and worst than dead pigs and dogs! ha! ha! ha!
therefore, refrain from acting rich and godly....
ha! ha! ha!
if i am too fast, it means only one thing..
you are too old, too senile, and you are better of dead than alive.
it happens when you outlive your resourcefulness...
i repeat
it happens when you outlive your resourcefulness...
senile but proud and stupid.
ha! ha! ha!
