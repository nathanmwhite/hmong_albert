npoj yaig,
1.  puas muaj hmoob from china or vietnam tuaj hauv no thiab?  yog muaj no, lawd yog leejtwg?  kuv nyob hauv sch tau 15+ years lawm (ever since alex lor told me about this site back in 94 i believe), temsis kuv ho tsi pay attention to who all of you people are or where you are from li.
2. so far, cov neeg uas kuv paub meej ces yog hawj lauj and pao xwb (and maina)...kuv xij tham nrog phwvnyawm li uas kuv paub nws zoo heev, temsis the truth is, i have no idea who he is.  i'm getting older and older, and it seems i'm talking to "ghosts."
would it be a good idea to actually share our bios in here?  los yog nej twb sis paub tag lawm, es tshuav kuv xwb na?
