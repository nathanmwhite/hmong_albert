zoo,
mus ua lag luam tim laos los yeej tsis ntshai kiag li, kuv xav tias haj
yam yuav tsis muaj competition loj li tim us no tiam sis tsuas yog tias
one might generate a very small profit due to the low currency value.
assuming that if you start a small-medium business, say
$500,000-700,000 you might only generate $500-1000 per day, how can you
survive with such a low gross income? even though the wage and other
expenses are relatively lower than here in the us, one would unlikely
able to pay for the monthly loan. tsis tag li ntawd xwb yuav tsum tau
mus nyob kiag ti mas thiaj li yuav run tau lub business thiab ne, tsis
li ntawd ces business kawg tuag xwb. may be in the future saib puas
muaj cov tswv xej thim branch lawv cov manufacture mus xwb. kuv xav
tias yog cov major corporation li gm thiab lwm lub manufactures loj loj
mus ua es xa khoom rov coj los muag tim us no mas yuav tsum mus tau zoo
xwb xwb.

very good question, in deed. with the situation laos has i am sure any
one in lpdr's shoes will do the same. let's wait and see as a few of
our hmong are currently doing business in laos.
kuv xaav hab xaam pum tas yog tsis muaj kev cai lijchoj zoo hab
strictly enforeced ces txawm yuav yog koomtshaas los yog lwm yaam blog
tug xeeb ceem yeej tsi txawv. ua ke ntawd peb cov mhoob los yeej tseem
tsi tau muaj cov kws yog business professionals tag tag. taab txawm yog
nyob teb chaws nua los yog leej twg ua business tsis raws nwg tug haaj
khawv business ces kawg maag ntsa (screwed up) xwb.
