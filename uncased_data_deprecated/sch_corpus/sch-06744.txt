i won't let this go until you can show me logically on why it is absurd
right?
note that this wasn't the first time you said it, or will it be the last
time you say it.  i will get to the bottom of your claim.  and if you
refuse, or say that you "have no time for this nonsense", then i would
conclude that you're nothing more than a foolish, unknowledgable,
illogical hypocrite who knows nothing about using logic and apply it to
a claim.
yaweh
