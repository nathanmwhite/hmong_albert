txog ib tsoom hmoob cov ntxim hlub (poj niiam), thiab  ntxim nyiam
(txiv neeg) sawv daws.
txij thaum kuv paub hias tias kuv yog ib tug hmoob, kuv yeej pom peb
hmoob coj lub cuj pwm zoo li nram no:
1.	luag tsaj tsis nrog luaj tsaj ces yus yuav ua dev nuam yaj.
2.	thaum dej hlob zoo dov cav yeej meem dov cag
3.	peb ib txwm ntseeg tus dag (hias lus cuav) ntau tshaj tus tiag (tus
hais lus tseeb).
4.	peb xum ntseeg tus neeg ua: "has no education, and no
experience"  than thos that has goo education, skill, experience and
had legally done before.
kuv niam haiv rau kuv tias:
txiv ntoo nyob chaw siab"
yuav tsum rau rau siab khw, thiab rau rau siab kawm ntawd
xyaum ua neeg zoo, txhob mus dag luag tej, ua neeg siab ncaj, txhob
nqia dub.
txhob lam mus mloog lus xaiv lus cua.
peb hmoob mas ntshai ntshai tsam lwm tus yeej yus thiab yus xav koom
yus tau ntau tshaj.
peb hmoob tsis yog hom neeg ua yuav noj mus ib txhis, tab sis noj ib
vuag xwb (4-5 hlis, tej zaum ib xyoo xwb) ces khaub hlab tas lawm.
let me gave you a few multi-level crooks/non crook :
al william, wma, prime america, wlg, tax-people, aim way, 1000 tau
5000, etc...you name it. many of these are legal and save/safe
mult-level organization, and many aren't.
peb tsis mus kawm ntawv, peb tsuas xav txog txoj kev kawm nthawv xwb.
kom peb mus hauj lwm, mas peb mus thov welfare thiab ssi xwb.
muaj coob tus tseem hluas  taws niaj hnub mus tim asian cuisine, dara
thai, vinai, lucy night club tuaj mus xoom thiaj nthawv tas hmo tab sis

tam sim no peb tseem mus vwm rau "bioperformace" lawm thiab. xyo li
laud....
i know that we must risk --- but i said please risk money and energy,
but not your life.
while testing the green pill:
dr. belfield and his ucf students made an interesting discovery.  ''it
smells like mothballs," meredith said. decades ago, mothballs were made
of a chemical called naphthalene. so they tested the pill, and bingo.
''naphthalene?" meredith asked."naphthalene. that's right," belfield
said.  it's almost 100 percent; the rest is coloring. "you have a
little graph and everything?" meredith asked belfield. on his graph, a
red line represented the chemical naphthalene, and a black line
represented the little green pill. they matched.
"the two spectra are identical," belfield said. what's more, on the
bottle, bioperformance claims the little green pill is "non toxic" but
naphthalene is toxic. in fact, decades ago, children died after eating
mothballs made of naphthalene. it even has links to cancer.
tsoom hmoob yuav ua dab tsis maj mam saib maj mam xyua mas li ua os
mog.
