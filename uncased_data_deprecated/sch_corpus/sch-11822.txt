cov phoojywg,
kuv saib mas yam li nej hais tsis sib haum kiag li puas yog? peb yeej
paub hais tias hmoob cov nom ces coj tus yam ntxwv txawv tsis deb peb
yawg hlob gvp li. nws hais li ntawd kom cov pej xeem huab hwm ntseeg
hais tias nws yog tus muaj txiaj ntsim rau sawvdaws es kom sawvdaws
poog nws. yog thaum sawvdaws poog nws lawm ces peb sawvdaws thiaj los
ua ib qhoo xwb. thaum peb los ua ib qhoo lawm ces peb lub zog yuav loj
dua, peb yuav ua dabtsi los peb yeej muaj lub peev xwm ua tau.
tabsis qhov nws yuam kev me ntsis ces yog nws underestimate nws cov
pej xeem lawm. niaj hnub no nws cov pej xeem feem coob tsis yog cov
ruam ruam qauj thiab xav xav kom nws tsa ua nom li yav thaud lawm. yog
nws hais qhov tseeb ces suavdaws hawv nws, tabsis yog nws hais qhov
tsis tseeb, claim yuav qhov credit tag nrhog ces muaj coob lej haj yam
yuav thuam thiab txav deb ntawm nws. zoo tsis zoo tseem ua rau nws
poob credit thiab ntshe hmoob tseem sib tawg ntxiv thiab xwb, vim muaj
ib txhia mas nws hais yog thiab tsis yog los npuab nws tag nrho, hos
muaj ib txhia mas xav hnov cov lus tseeb thiab lus yog xwb. saib nej
ua piv txwv xwb los mas!
qhov tseeb thiab qhov yog ces hais li no, yeej yog muaj yawg hlob gvp
thiab peb thiaj tau tuaj, tabsis tsis yog nws ib leeg xwb, yog muaj
ntau ntau tus neeg, ntau ntau lub koomhaum, ntau ntau lub tebchaws,
etc..., peb thiaj tau tuaj. hos ntawm kuv tus kheej, thawj thawj tug
uas tau txais credit ces yog kuv tus tij laug. nws yog tus uas tau ua
tub rog rau cia, nws thiaj tau tuaj ua nte, ces nws mam ua ntaub ntawv
los tos kuv tuaj.
hl

hmong-lao-- tos peb hmoob nyob txog lub teb chaws twg los pheej tsis
haum nrog luag cov neeg nyob lub teb chaws ntawd li los vim yog peb
hmoob tsis muaj advisors li ne.  nej saib luag lwm haiv neeg tej nom
mas luag muaj cov advisors laiv.  piv li yog president bush yuav mus
suav teb los yog yuav tawm tv/public tham ib qhov topic txog suav mas
president bush twb mus consult nrog nws tus advisor paub thiab muaj
knowledge txog suav zoo zoo tag mas luag mam mus hais luag cov lus
tawm.  thaum luag mus hais luag cov lus thiaj tsis yuam kev thiab
thiaj tsis mob tsis raug leej twg li no ov.  nyob li yang dao thiab vp
lawv cov no los yuav tsum tau muaj advisors thiab mas lawv mus hais
lus thiaj tsis muaj kev cov nyom ov.

zhen,

cuabyeej, nyaj txag hab movnoj ces pej xeem fuabfwm kawg yuav tsum
noog tug ntawd has. gvp yeej yog ib tug thawj tub rog ntse, tawv hab
muaj peev xwm heev and i have great respect for that but the fact to
the matter is he was at the right time and the right place xwb. the
american came over to the southeast asian to engage communism with the
eyes at the hmong who were chased and hated by all the majorities of
that region hoping to use them for their own gain and could abandone
them without much liabilities. however, i believe, the world has
changed and when they left not just the hmong that fled but also the
vietnamese, the khmere, the laotians and others. for that reason
american has no other choice but to accept the hmong as well. have you
ever heard what john tucker said about the hmong in 1975?

yog le ces txhais has tas peb yuav tsum zeem tseeb (accept) hab leeg (claim) has tas txiv naisphoo yog tug coj
peb hmoob tuaj mas txhaj yog qhov tseeb nuav lov?
tseeb tsis tseeb los (raws li liab dawb hais), muaj "ntau tus hmoob
claim hais tias" tseeb lawm.  yog li, tej uas "liab" hais tias cov
claim ntawd tsis tseeb no es yog tsis tseeb rau leej twg tiag mas?
ntau tus hais tias tseeb, "liab" hais tias tsis tseeb.  who should
establish what is truth?  if 100 witnesses said "it's true", and one
said, "it's not true".  who should we believe?

yawg sib,
so what "are" you saying? koj twb "cav cav" tias tsis yog no neb? take
a stand. be clear. it's very easy to do.
zoo li koj yog xeem yaj, kuv niam los kuj yog xeem yaj. ces kuv kawg
hu koj ua "yuam txiv" or "dab laug" lawm. so, ytms or dlms, tej no kuv
"hais" xwb nab. kuv tsis yog ua kom leej twg qhov twg "tim kaum tsev"
nab. you characterize my words too extremely, ces qhov no koj yuam kev
koj xwb nawb mog.
es kuv twb hais rau koj ne, tej nej pheej txhais mus rau qhov yuam kev
yog raws "technicality" tiam si, tej hmoob hais hais "vp coj peb tuaj"
no yog "causality" nab. koj puas nkag siab maj?
ytms aka dlms aws, cas es, hais tsis raug qhov issue lawm tseem siv
mus tsuag ntshav 6 thiab lauj. yog koj xav tham txog saum txaj xwb ces
tsis thas thas hais ntxiv li mas. cia kuv thiab koj rov qab sib cov
lus txia kua 8 txia kua 6 xwb. are you sure you want to go there? cia
lary tuaj ntsia peb cov tigers no sib tog kom lary luag vau hlo zoo
dua. puas yog?
so, englighten me, who else? kuv twb hais kom qhia npe ne... tsis tag
li ntawv, kuv twb qhia kiag npe cov es hais hais txwv tsis pub hmoob
hla dej mekong ne... take a stand, be firm, be clear.
hahahaha. "right time and right place xwb". that is a weak argument.
you can say that of anyone, including george washington, abe lincoln,
gw bush, nelson mandela, etc... on one hand, you praise gvp, on the
other hand, you try to dismiss him by reducing his efforts to "right
time and right place." like i said and asked you, how many hmong/laos/
khmu/etc... did the cia visit before settling on gvp to spear the
effort against north vietnamese invasion of laos? right time, right
place, right person = right.
puas yuav yog maj? according to ctj and others "rumors" i have heard
and tried to research, amekas cog lus nrog hmoob laiv. will these
documents and agreements come to light? who will make the
breakthrough?
b/c they all took part. if gvp was the only one, i am sure, he would
be the only hmong here.
who is john tucker? what did he say? pray tell.
thanks.

thanks.
john tucker was a key player (cia) in laos.  ok so he was a "usaid
official", but we know better.  many lao know him.  john tucker said
many things about the hmongs, so i don't know what moosib is hinting
at.
