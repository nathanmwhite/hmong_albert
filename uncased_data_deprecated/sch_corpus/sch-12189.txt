it used to be that despotic and authoritarian regimes lasted a long
long time, take the roman empire that lasted more than a thousand
years. not anymore. now with the advance of the internet, regimes can
be changed over night.
this arab spring revolution that has spread all over the middle east
has caught many people by surprise. it's been said that them arab
muslims are too consumed by their religion to even think about freedom
and stuff. that line of reasoning has been amply proven false.
from here on out, no regime especially the bad ones can last forever.
