wanting to be a lao citizen is not unlawful, but being a us citizen
and is involved in activities aimed at destabilizing a soveign nation
like laos is. those who participated in such activities ought to be
prosecuted to the full extend of the laws.
sometimes i wonder if they wanted to fight the lpdr so much, why the
fuck are they here in us? to slave themself, had enough money to buy a
pc and the internet service, and making an empty threat to those who
disagreed with them and their ideology? what a fucking loser...ran
away from home so they can mouth off elsewhere....is that the
honorable conduct which they often claim? boy, talking about these
fucking idiots won't get you anywhere.
