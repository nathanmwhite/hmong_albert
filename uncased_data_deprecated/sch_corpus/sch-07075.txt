lao..
by the way, yog tias koj tsi paub tiag...los yog koj lam tau lam hais
xwb, ces qhia ncaj ncaj...i will only laugh "once"..and that will
be the end of it...temsis, yog koj tsi nyoo poob ntsej muag, then
go right aghead and keep on missing the target as you did this pass
few days...that would only show that the "great logical lao" is nothing
more than a fool...
off the subject...ignore this if you can't understand the analogy.  when
a woman touches your crotch...that usually means she is ready to
perform some sort of sexual act with you.  when she goes down on you,
that usually means she is "almost" there to 2nd or third base with you.
my advice is, stick to the sexual act, instead of talking about lao tzu,
or plato, or "tale of two cities" when she's doing u a favor.
my point is, you brought up absurdity in pao's original statement.  now,
it is time for you to use logic/common sense/education/science to back
up your claim...we all know that the shortest distance between two
points is a straght line...now it is time for you to use this logic and
tell me why it is 'absurd' as you said.
by the way, there is a difference between "unsupported, illogical
claims" and "logical reasonong" for claims.  can you differentiate the
two?

hmoob..
perhaps during this hot tempered time, i failed to realized which
comment i made...please, do point out...maybe i could clear it up...
maybe i was wrong...but if i'm wrong, then of course, like any man, i
will admit to it.  i'm not like lauj, who makes alot of claims, but
fail to support those claims.
but you should know that, usually the main parties of an argument
sometimes failed to see their "faultiness."  so i do encourage you to
point out what i said that seem to be offensive.

sai..
you are generalizing to "people" as a whole, but i do encourage you
show where the "mistakes" are...both for me, and lao...
let me be more specific...
1)was lauj a fool to claim that "keeping
a married woman's true name is the right way" is absurd?
2)was i a fool for calling lauj an idiot for not using logic, education,
science, common sense to support his claim?
