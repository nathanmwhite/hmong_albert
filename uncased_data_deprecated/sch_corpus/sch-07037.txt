hello
i have asked many elder 55 to 75 mostly men and they all come to a
similar answer: here is the answer. whatever they give is their terms,
their times,their organizatio, their psychologies. some even told me
that you younger people don't know what was life like in the past in
laos no one can do thing for hmong like vp did. i shutted my mouth.
